   Physicians and scientists on the faculty of the Icahn School of
   Medicine at Mount Sinai often interact with pharmaceutical, device and
   biotechnology companies to improve patient care, develop new therapies
   and achieve scientific breakthroughs. In order to promote an ethical
   and transparent environment for conducting research, providing clinical
   care and teaching, Mount Sinai requires that salaried faculty inform
   the School of their relationships with such companies.

   Dr. Yu did not report having any of the following types of financial
   relationships with industry during 2014 and/or 2015: consulting,
   scientific advisory board, industry-sponsored lectures, service on
   Board of Directors, participation on industry-sponsored committees,
   equity ownership valued at greater than 5% of a publicly traded company
   or any value in a privately held company. Please note that this
   information may differ from information posted on corporate sites due
   to timing or classification differences.

   Mount Sinai's faculty policies relating to faculty collaboration with
   industry are posted on our website. Patients may wish to ask their
   physician about the activities they perform for companies.
