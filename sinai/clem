   Emotional experiences leave an enduring record in the brain by way of
   structural and molecular remodeling of cells and synapses.  While these
   modifications help organisms respond appropriately to threats and
   rewards, they also contribute to maladaptive states like addiction and
   post-traumatic stress disorder.  Many key characteristics of emotional
   memory mirror those of synaptic plasticity in reduced neuronal
   preparations.  For example, both involve changes in neurotransmission
   that can persist for long periods provided they undergo molecular
   stabilization.  We now recognize, however, that this basic model fails
   to capture the complexity of processes that contribute to emotional
   memory storage, or that update or inhibit memory as behavioral
   conditions change.
   We utilize molecular and electrophysiological approaches, including
   optogenetic stimulation, to identify how associative fear conditioning
   modifies neural pathways and individual neurons in limbic and cortical
   brain regions.  Once fear responses are established, other experiments
   address the mechanisms that contribute to their long-term maintenance,
   as well as their reinforcement or attenuation by molecular and
   behavioral interventions.

   Work in my lab is focused on how experience alters the function of
   brain circuits to encode emotional responses.
