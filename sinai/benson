   A striking feature of the mature central nervous system is the
   precision of its synaptic circuitry. More than 20 billion neurons in
   the human brain are precisely connected with one another through
   trillions of synapses. Much of the wiring is established in the absence
   of neural activity or experience indicating the basic organization of
   neural pathways is encoded in the genetic program. Recent studies
   support that several devastating developmental diseases, including
   autism and schizophrenia, have as their root cause modifications in the
   genetic program that ultimately disrupt the balance of synaptic
   connections. In order to understand how synapse specificity is achieved
   and how it is altered in human diseases, we investigate mechanisms
   controlling pathway development and synaptogenesis in development and
   how these same mechanisms influence synapse stability and plasticity in
   adulthood.
