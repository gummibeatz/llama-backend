   Dr. Xuâs lab develops quantitative and functional magnetic resonance
   (MR) techniques and applies them to study neurometablism and
   neuropathophysiology.
   Our current projects are to develop: (1) fast MR imaging and
   spectroscopy methods for quantitative neuroimaging, (2) reliable MR
   techniques for functional assessment of spinal cord, and (3) a
   âConnectomicâ imaging approach for tissue recovery, repair and clinical
   outcomes in multiple sclerosis
