   Summary of Research Studies:
   Perhaps the most fundamental process in biology is that by which one
   cell becomes two. Our research focuses on two related aspects of the
   biology that controls the integrity of the genome.


   1. We study the control of the cell division cycle, and the signaling
   pathways (checkpoints) that respond to chromosomal damage and prevent
   cell cycle progression until that damage is repaired.


   DNA damage checkpoints function throughout the cell cycle. Those
   working in G1 phase to prevent the replication of damaged DNA are
   almost invariably mutated or inactivated in cancers. These defects
   contribute not only to the instability of tumor cell genomes, but can
   also knock-out pro-apoptotic pathways, rendering tumors resistant to
   treatment. Those functioning in G2 phase to prevent commitment to
   mitosis are, however, virtually always intact and appear to be required
   for the viability of tumor cells that lack G1 checkpoints. Our research
   is geared to dissect the molecular and cell biology of G2 checkpoints,
   and aims to use this knowledge in the design and testing of targeted
   anti-cancer therapies. Taking genetic and genomic approaches, we
   utilize fission yeast as a gene and pathway discovery tool, and then
   apply this information to studies in human cells. We are currently
   focusing our efforts into: (1) the regulation and function of a
   checkpoint effector protein kinase, Chk1, informing its suitability as
   a target in anti-cancer therapy; and (2) the initiating events that
   modify lesions in DNA into structures that signal the checkpoint and
   can be repaired.


   2. We are investigating how determinants of chromosome structure
   regulate chromosome segregation and DNA repair, with an emphasis on
   events that occur during DNA replication.


   Chromosomes are highly dynamic structures. They undergo massive
   reorganization to enable DNA replication and chromosome segregation to
   occur. This is under the control of the DNA topoisomerases, and three
   related and interacting Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC)
   complexes known as cohesin, condensin and the Smc5/6 complex. Defects
   in the processes controlled by these enzymes are a potent inducer of
   chromosome segregation defects leading to changes in chromosome number
   (aneuploidy). Their function during DNA replication appears to be
   particularly important, where they control recombination to ensure a
   complete round of replication by overcoming obstacles that block
   polymerases, which is then followed by chromosome reorganization in
   preparation for mitosis.  With the importance of replication fidelity,
   cells have back-up mechanisms controlled by a multi-BRCT domain protein
   (Brc1/PTIP) and the post-replication repair (PRR) machinery. We are
   focusing our efforts to understanding how these various genome
   integrity determinants are integrated in time and space to ensure
   accurate replication and division of the genome.

   Physicians and scientists on the faculty of the Icahn School of
   Medicine at Mount Sinai often interact with pharmaceutical, device and
   biotechnology companies to improve patient care, develop new therapies
   and achieve scientific breakthroughs. In order to promote an ethical
   and transparent environment for conducting research, providing clinical
   care and teaching, Mount Sinai requires that salaried faculty inform
   the School of their relationships with such companies.

   Dr. O'Connell did not report having any of the following types of
   financial relationships with industry during 2014 and/or 2015:
   consulting, scientific advisory board, industry-sponsored lectures,
   service on Board of Directors, participation on industry-sponsored
   committees, equity ownership valued at greater than 5% of a publicly
   traded company or any value in a privately held company. Please note
   that this information may differ from information posted on corporate
   sites due to timing or classification differences.

   Mount Sinai's faculty policies relating to faculty collaboration with
   industry are posted on our website. Patients may wish to ask their
   physician about the activities they perform for companies.
