   Dr. Germano joined the faculty at Mount Sinai in 1993. She is Director
   of The Mount Sinai Comprehensive Brain Tumor Program, an advanced
   multidisciplinary program based on computer-assisted image-guided
   neurosurgery and brain mapping to accomplish minimally invasive
   procedures and treatment of brain tumors, and is Co-director of the
   Radiosurgery Program.
   You can learn more about Dr. Germano by visiting the Neurosurgery
   Tumors website.
   Her specialty interests include Brain Tumors, Computer-Assisted
   Image-Guided Neurosurgery, Epilepsy surgery andÂ  Radiosurgery. She is
   Director of The Mount Sinai Medical Center Comprehensive Brain Tumor
   Program, an advanced multidisciplinary program based on
   computer-assisted image-guided neurosurgery and brain mapping to
   accomplish minimally invasive procedures and treatment of brain tumors.
   Dr. Germano is one of the pioneers of computer-assisted image-guided
   neurosurgery. This sophisticated technology, including the Novalis
   Shaped Beam Surgery, is used to perform minimally invasive surgery for
   patients with brain tumors, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and movement
   disorders. Active in national neurosurgery organizations, she has
   served as an executive committee member for the Congress of
   Neurosurgery (CNS), as a Board of Directors' member for the American
   Association of Neurological Surgeons, as an executive committee member
   of the AANS/CNS Joint Section on Tumors, and as a scientific program
   member for the AANS, CNS, and the American Epilepsy Society. For the
   past five years she has directed a course, Advanced Techniques in
   Image-Guided Brain and Spine Surgery, for neurosurgeons from around the
   country.In the News

   Physicians and scientists on the faculty of the Icahn School of
   Medicine at Mount Sinai often interact with pharmaceutical, device and
   biotechnology companies to improve patient care, develop new therapies
   and achieve scientific breakthroughs. In order to promote an ethical
   and transparent environment for conducting research, providing clinical
   care and teaching, Mount Sinai requires that salaried faculty inform
   the School of their relationships with such companies.

   Below are financial relationships with industry reported by Dr. Germano
   during 2014 and/or 2015. Please note that this information may differ
   from information posted on corporate sites due to timing or
   classification differences.

   Consulting:

   Mount Sinai's faculty policies relating to faculty collaboration with
   industry are posted on our website. Patients may wish to ask their
   physician about the activities they perform for companies.

   Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) physicians - including those employed
   by MSHS - do not always participate in the same health plans in which
   MSHS hospitals or facilities participate.

   Information regarding insurance participation and billing by this
   physician may be found on this page or obtained by contacting this
   provider directly.

   Insurance plans that the Mount Sinai Health System hospitals or
   facilities participate in can be found on the Mount Sinai Health System
   website.
