   To study the molecular mechanisms of drug addiction and depression, a
   lot of high throughput experimental data have been generated. Our lab
   focuses on the statistical and integrated analysis of these data and
   generates biological insights. We are especially interested in the
   next-generation sequencing data which provides a comprehensive and
   high-resolution view of the biological systems under study. We also
   develop bioinformatic tools employing Bayesian inference and machine
   learning to aid our data analysis.
