   We are using newly available structural information of opioid receptors
   in computer simulations to discover/design novel painkillers with
   reduced abuse liability and other adverse effects.

   We are running massive computer simulations to find out how membrane
   protein complexes process cell signaling so that we can make drugs more
   specific and design more efficient medicines.

   We continue to use information from structure and molecular dynamics
   simulations to discover novel therapeutics to treat renal, hematologic,
   neoplastic, bone, and/or fibrotic diseases.
