   Our mission is to integrate state-of-the-art technologies, animal
   models and drug discovery to promote a Center of Excellence for Myelin
   Repair.
   The overall goal is to move towards personalized regenerative medicine
   and design of new therapeutic strategies to repair the damage and
   restore function.

   RESEARCH OVERVIEW:
   Our ability to move, think, perceive, is dependent on a timely
   transmission of information among specialized cells called neurons.
   This information is sent via a series of electrical impulses that
   travel along specialized structures called "axons", whose ability to
   conduct signal is dependent on the presence of "myelin".
   Myelin is a fatty substance composed of lipids and proteins that is an
   integral component of a cell called "oligodendrocyte".
   Oligodendrocytes are the myelin-forming cells of the CNS and are
   essential for brain function.
   Oligodendrocytes originate from neural stem cells that undergo several
   changes before reaching the stage of late maturation.

   The laboratory is working in major research areas:

   I am interested in translational research in regenerative and
   personalized medicine. With the help of my team we made several
   contributions to elucidating the molecular mechanisms responsible for
   oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin formation during
   development.
