   Dr. Tangâs lab is involved with the research and development of novel
   imaging strategies for the study of neuro-psychiatric diseases. The
   work consists of both hardware and software development.

   The lab develops novel image analysis software approaches to integrate
   functional and structural connectivity using DTI, DSI and fMRI.

   The lab has also developed novel technologies (e.g. olfactory meter,
   real time fMRI) in use for the study of memory, OCD and mood-disorders.

   The research is performed on both human and preclinical systems.
