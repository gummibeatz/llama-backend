   Research in the Baxter lab focuses on the neural mechanisms of
   learning, memory, executive function, and decision-making, and the ways
   in which these mechanisms fail in aging and neuropsychiatric disorders.
   Our research interests are broad and include the functional
   neuroanatomy of frontal and temporal cortex, regulation of higher
   cognitive functions by neuromodulators, the biological basis of
   cognitive impairments in neurodegenerative disease and neuropsychiatric
   conditions, as well as the neurobiological and cognitive effects of
   general anesthesia. Our approach to answering questions about the
   relationship between brain systems and cognition is to interfere with
   the function of defined neural systems in experimental animal models,
   and determine the consequences of this interference on behavior.
