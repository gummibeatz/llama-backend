   Paul J. Kenny, PhD, is Ward-Coleman Professor and Chair of the Dorothy
   H. and Lewis Rosenstiel Department of Pharmacology and Systems
   Therapeutics. Dr. Kenny also serves as the Director of the Experimental
   Therapeutics Institute. His multidisciplinary research involves the
   study of behavioral paradigms, physiological analyses, and the
   molecular underpinnings of neurobehavioral disorders. Dr. Kenny is
   actively investigating the brains of rodents to uncover new signaling
   cascades that may play a role in addiction-like behaviors.

   Physicians and scientists on the faculty of the Icahn School of
   Medicine at Mount Sinai often interact with pharmaceutical, device and
   biotechnology companies to improve patient care, develop new therapies
   and achieve scientific breakthroughs. In order to promote an ethical
   and transparent environment for conducting research, providing clinical
   care and teaching, Mount Sinai requires that salaried faculty inform
   the School of their relationships with such companies.

   Below are financial relationships with industry reported by Dr. Kenny
   during 2014 and/or 2015. Please note that this information may differ
   from information posted on corporate sites due to timing or
   classification differences.

   Equity (Stock or stock options valued at greater than 5% ownership of a
   publicly traded company or equity of any value in a privately held
   company)

   Mount Sinai's faculty policies relating to faculty collaboration with
   industry are posted on our website. Patients may wish to ask their
   physician about the activities they perform for companies.
