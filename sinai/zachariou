   Our research focuses on the cellular mechanisms underlying CNS
   disorders and their treatment. We use advanced genetic mouse models,
   viral mediated gene transfer and optogenetics to understand the network
   and cell type specific mechanisms underlying chronic pain, addiction,
   and depression.   A large part of our work, concerns the study of RGS
   proteins (Regulators of G protein signaling) in the brain.  RGS
   proteins modulate a number of important functions in the CNS by
   regulating the activity of heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunits but
   also by various other interactions which affect receptor
   desentitization, ion channel function or transcriptional activity.  Our
   earlier work revealed a potent role of RGS9-2 in the striatum in drug
   addiction and identified RGS9-2 complexes associated with agonist
   biased signaling. More recently, we explored the role of RGS4 in
   antidepressant drug actions and its role in various forms of chronic
   pain.

   We focus on five major research areas:

   Signal transduction complexes in the striatum in drug addiction

   Regulation of G protein signaling in stress and depression

   Novel intracellular targets for chronic pain treatment

   Epigenetic adaptations in chronic pain models

   Regulators of G protein signaling and obesity
