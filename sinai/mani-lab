   As a faculty member at TMII and Director of the Cardiovascular Imaging
   Clinical trials Units (CICTU), Dr. Mani works to translate novel
   multi-modality imaging techniques for use in multicenter clinical
   trials. His main interests are in imaging of cardiovascular diseases,
   specifically focusing on atherosclerosis, thrombosis and their
   complications using FDG-PET, CT and MRI. Â The CICTU is composed of
   clinicians, image processing and programming experts, image analysts,
   data managers, IT personnel and research coordinators. CICTU is a
   modern hybrid between a contract research organization (CRO) and an
   imaging core lab. They undertake and manage all aspects of clinical
   trials, ranging from scientific conduct to administrative management,
   with imaging endpoints led by TMII. CICTUâs tasks span from industry or
   federally sponsored multicenter clinical trials to the support of
   individual investigators interested in using imaging endpoints for
   their work. Â Typical services offered include but are not limited to
   trial design and consultation, imaging protocol development, site
   training and qualification, data repository and database management,
   data quality control and analysis, and publication support.
