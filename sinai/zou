   The lab is interested in molecular mechanisms of how neurons are born,
   how they extend axons, and how they regenerate or fail to regenerate
   after mammalian CNS injury. We use in vivo axon injury models, neuronal
   cultures, molecular biology, and various imaging and tissue engineering
   techniques to study classic and identify novel signaling pathways and
   epigenetic mechanisms that promote neurogenesis and axonogenesis. Such
   knowledge is crucial for targeting molecules for effective CNS
   regeneration. Similar mechanisms also have relevance in CNS tumor
   biology. Discovering the molecular driving forces of tumor stem cell
   migration, proliferation, differentiation and self-renewal will point
   to novel therapeutic approaches.
