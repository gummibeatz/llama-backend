   Dr. Balchandaniâs research is focused on the design of innovative radio
   frequency (RF) pulses and pulse sequences that harness the power of
   high-field magnets and exploit new contrast mechanisms in order to
   enable novel applications of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Â Her
   lab explores engineering solutions for MR imaging and spectroscopy at
   high magnetic fields such as 7 Tesla (7T). Beyond higher resolution
   images that elucidate finer anatomical features, high-field MR offers
   greater spectral resolution for spectroscopic imaging, new and enhanced
   contrast mechanisms and improved detection of nuclei other than protons
   that are essential to cell processes. Â A main goal of Dr.
   Balchandaniâs lab is to develop techniques that exploit the benefits
   offered by 7T magnets for neuroimaging applications by overcoming the
   limitations associated with their operation. Â Dr. Balchandaniâs
   additional research interests include creative pulse and pulse sequence
   designs for nontraditional MR applications such as multinuclear imaging
   and stem cell tracking.
