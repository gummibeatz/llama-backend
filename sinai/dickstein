   Research in the Dickstein lab focuses on the structural changes on
   neurons with ageing and disease. Our main research interests focus on
   Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, specifically targeting
   cells of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, areas crucial for
   cognition. We also investigate the effects of cancers and chemotherapy
   on neuronal and synapse integrity. We use a combination of transgenic
   mouse models, neuroanatomy, and confocal and electron microscopy to
   analyze the changes that neurons and synapses undergo during disease.
