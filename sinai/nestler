   The goal of our research is to better understand the molecular
   mechanisms of addiction and depression. We use animal models of these
   disorders to identify the ways in which long-term exposure to drugs of
   abuse or stress changes the brain to lead to addiction- or
   depression-like syndromes. A major focus of our work is on drug- and
   stress-induced changes in gene expression and chromatin structure
   within the brain's reward circuitry.
