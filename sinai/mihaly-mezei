   New topic

   Specific Clinical/Research Interest:
   Computer simulation of aqueous systems; methodology and biomolecular
   applications

   Summary of Research Studies:
   Research in my laboratory centers on developing computational
   techniques for the modeling and understanding of complex molecular
   systems such as proteins and nucleic acids in their aqueous
   environments. The methods developed are applied to problems of interest
   in structural biology. Methodological developments focus on novel
   techniques to calculate free energy from computer simulations, on
   extending the range of applicability of grand-canonical ensemble
   simulations, on enhancing Monte Carlo sampling algorithms and on
   developing novel approaches to the analysis and visualization of
   macromolecular structures and computer simulation results. These
   techniques are applied to the calculation of the solvent contribution
   to conformational free energy differences between various conformation
   of polypeptides, drug candidates; probing ionic solvation; modeling
   lipid bilayers. In addition, ligand-protein interactions are studied by
   docking tecniques and by molecular dynamics. Recent work showed that
   grand-canonical ensemble simulations can be used to predict sites for
   derivatizing a ligand in order to enhance its binding affinity.

   Physicians and scientists on the faculty of the Icahn School of
   Medicine at Mount Sinai often interact with pharmaceutical, device and
   biotechnology companies to improve patient care, develop new therapies
   and achieve scientific breakthroughs. In order to promote an ethical
   and transparent environment for conducting research, providing clinical
   care and teaching, Mount Sinai requires that salaried faculty inform
   the School of their relationships with such companies.

   Dr. Mezei has not yet completed reporting of Industry relationships.

   Mount Sinai's faculty policies relating to faculty collaboration with
   industry are posted on our website. Patients may wish to ask their
   physician about the activities they perform for companies.
