   In parallel studies, we have recently discovered that the large family
   of potassium channel proteins, that include the G protein-sensitive
   channels, function by direct interactions with phosphatidylinositol
   phospholipids in the plasma membrane. G protein signaling is likely to
   activate these channels conformationally by adjusting channel
   phospholipid interactions. Moreover, signaling pathways that regulate
   the level of these phospholipids critically affect the function of
   these potassium channels. \r\n\r\n\r\n

   Cardiac and neuronal cells of the central nervous system, where these
   channels are prevalent, are isolated from heart and brain and are
   studied electrophysiologically. Transgenic models with defects in G
   proteins or the potassium channel are used to elucidate the functional
   importance of these molecules in the particular tissue and the whole
   organism. \r\n\r\n\r\n

   The lab employs electrophysiological techniques to assay ion channel
   function (patch clamp, two-electrode voltage clamp). Molecular
   biological techniques are used to clone and perform structure-function
   studies on these potassium channels. Expression of recombinant channels
   in Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cell lines are used routinely towards
   mechanistic studies. Cell isolation methods and tissue culture
   techniques are also routinely used. Confocal microscopy is used to
   localize the channel proteins in cells and tissues. \r\n\r\n

   Physicians and scientists on the faculty of the Icahn School of
   Medicine at Mount Sinai often interact with pharmaceutical, device and
   biotechnology companies to improve patient care, develop new therapies
   and achieve scientific breakthroughs. In order to promote an ethical
   and transparent environment for conducting research, providing clinical
   care and teaching, Mount Sinai requires that salaried faculty inform
   the School of their relationships with such companies.

   Dr.Logothetis is not currently required to report Industry
   relationships.

   Mount Sinai's faculty policies relating to faculty collaboration with
   industry are posted on our website. Patients may wish to ask their
   physician about the activities they perform for companies.
