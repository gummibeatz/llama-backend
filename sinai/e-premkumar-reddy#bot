   National Cancer Institute

   Dr. E. Premkumar Reddy obtained his Ph.D. in 1971 and carried out his
   post-doctoral training at the UCLA School of Medicine from 1972-1974
   and later at the National Cancer Institute from 1974-75.   He worked at
   the National Cancer Institute first as an independent investigator and
   later as a section chief between 1975 and 1984.  In 1984, he moved to
   Hoffmann La Roche and held appointments at Hoffmann La Roche and the
   Roche Institute of Molecular Biology as a Full Member.  In 1986, he
   joined the Wistar Institute as a Professor and Deputy Director.  From
   1992 to 2010, he served as the Director of the Fels Institute for
   Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University School of
   Medicine, Philadelphia. He joined the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in
   March of 2010 as a Professor in the Departments of Oncological Sciences
   and the Department of Structural and Chemical Biology and as the
   Director of Experimental Cancer Therapeutics.

   While working at the National Cancer Institute, he made a number of
   seminal discoveries that provided a clear understanding of the
   molecular basis of cancer.  He cloned and sequenced a number of viral
   oncogenes which included abl, ras, fgr, mos, myb, myc and sis oncogenes
   and their cellular homologues which pinpointed the precise changes that
   cellular proto-oncogenes undergo to produce cancer-causing viral
   oncogenes.   He extended this work to human cancers and was responsible
   for the seminal discovery that point mutations in the cellular ras
   genes result in their oncogenic activation.  His work also showed the
   mechanisms associated with the activation of Abl and Myb oncogenes,
   which are associated with the development of human myelogenous
   leukemias. His recent work on cell cycle regulator, Cdk4 has shown that
   this gene is very critical for the development of ErbB2 and ras
   oncogene-induced tumors and inhibition of expression of Cdk4 causes
   ablation of breast cancers caused by ErbB2 and Ras oncogenes.
   Dr. Reddy has pioneered the development of small molecule inhibitors
   targeted against oncogenes and cell cycle regulators for cancer
   therapy.  One of the drugs developed by Dr. Reddy, ON01910 is currently
   in Phase III clinical trials and has shown profound clinical activity
   in MDS (Myelodysplastic Syndrome) patients as a single agent.  In
   combination with Oxaliplatin and Gemcitabine, ON01910 was found to have
   remarkable efficacy in reducing the tumor burden of several metastatic
   cancers including breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers.   In addition
   to ON01910, Dr. Reddy has developed six different cancer drugs, two of
   which (ON013100, and ON01210) have entered clinical trials and the
   other three are expected to enter clinical trials in the next one
   year.  Two of these drugs, a small molecule inhibitor of Plk2,
   ON1231320 and a second compounds ON123300 which is a dual inhibitor of
   Cdk4 and AKT pathways are currently undergoing pre-clinical evaluation.

   Dr. Reddy  founded the cancer journal Oncogene in 1986 and served as
   its Editor from 1986 to 2009.  In 2010, he founded a second cancer
   journal, Genes & Cancer for which he currently serves as the
   Editor-in-Chief.

   Physicians and scientists on the faculty of the Icahn School of
   Medicine at Mount Sinai often interact with pharmaceutical, device and
   biotechnology companies to improve patient care, develop new therapies
   and achieve scientific breakthroughs. In order to promote an ethical
   and transparent environment for conducting research, providing clinical
   care and teaching, Mount Sinai requires that salaried faculty inform
   the School of their relationships with such companies.
