   Dr. Aaronson is an internationally recognized cancer biologist, who in
   early studies established the transformation-competent but replication
   defective nature of mammalian sarcoma viruses and molecularly cloned
   many of their oncogenes. He and colleagues implicated
   retroviral-related oncogenes in human cancer through investigations
   including the initial detection of their expression in human tumors and
   critical contributions to the demonstration of their involvement in
   human cancer. His investigations of the v-sis oncogene established the
   first normal function of an oncogene and the role of oncogenes in
   growth factor signaling. His discovery of erbB2 as a v-erbB-related
   gene amplified in a human breast carcinoma and demonstration of its
   transforming properties paved the way for targeted therapies directed
   against its product.

   He isolated KGF (FGF7), a growth factor with novel epithelial cell
   specificity and demonstrated its involvement in wound repair. Its
   successful phase III clinical trial by Amgen for treatment of
   mucositis, recently led the FDA to approve Kepivance (KGF) for
   treatment of this debilitating side effect of many cancer therapies.
   Thus, Dr. Aaronson's pioneering discoveries have directly led to new
   therapies for cancer patients.

   His development and application of stable expression cDNA cloning
   technology resulted in his identification of new human oncogenes,
   growth factor receptors, and other genes, which induce transformation
   or drug resistance. He and colleagues identified the protooncogene
   product, MET, as the receptor for HGF/Scatter Factor and LRP5/6 as the
   receptor for a novel Wnt antagonist, Dkk1. This latter discovery paved
   the way for his recent demonstration with colleagues of a Wnt autocrine
   transforming mechanism in human malignancies.

   Dr. Aaronson received his M.D. from UCSF in 1966. He joined the
   National Institutes of Health in 1967 and became Chief of the
   Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology at the National Cancer
   Institute in 1977. He joined Mount Sinai in 1994 and is the Jack and
   Jane B. Aron Professor and Founding Chair, Emeritus of the Department
   of Oncological Sciences. He is the recipient of numerous awards
   including the Distinguished Service Medal from the U.S. Public Health
   Service, the Rhoads Memorial Award from the American Association of
   Cancer Research, and the Paul Erhlich Prize from Germany. He is the
   author of over 530 publications, an inventor on more than 50 patents,
   and serves on numerous editorial boards and scientific advisory
   committees.
