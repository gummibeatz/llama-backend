   I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Genetics and Genomics
   Sciences and a member of the Institute for Genomics and Multiscale
   Biology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. I am broadly interested
   in Bioinformatics/Computational Biology research topics.

   My primary focus is problems related to genomic architecture. In the
   past these problems have ranged from phylogenetics to detecting
   structural variation and gene fusions in human cancers. Currently, some
   of these projects include pathogen genome assembly and transcriptomics.
   My collaborators and I use whatever technologies are available but have
   specifically made use of the significant advances in genome sequencing
   made in the last few years.

   See the navigation menu above if you would like to learn more about my
   research, software, or are interested in contacting me about a
   position.
