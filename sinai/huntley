   Synapse structure and function is continuously modified during
   development and throughout life by experience, such as learning new
   skills or forming new memories. Such synaptic plasticity is thus
   critical for normal brain function. Synaptic plasticity can also become
   maladaptive under conditions of brain, spinal or peripheral nerve
   injury, leading to abnormal function or sensation. Dr. Huntley's
   research focuses on mechanisms of synaptic plasticity through which
   synaptic structure and function are modified by experience or injury.
   Research projects include: 1) the role of the cadherin family of
   synaptic adhesion proteins in synapse and circuit development,
   plasticity and repair; 2) the role of regulated extracellular
   proteolytic remodeling of cortical synapses in synaptic plasticity; and
   3) molecules and mechanisms regulating aberrant corticostriatal circuit
   development and plasticity in autism and Parkinson's disease models.
