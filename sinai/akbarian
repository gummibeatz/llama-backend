   The goal of our research is to explore the organization and packaging
   of the genome (which is comprised of 6 billion basepairs) inside the
   nuclei of human brain cells, including potential alterations in
   psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia, depression and autism. We
   study histone modifications and variants, chromosomal loopings and
   other building blocks of the epigenome in human brain tissue collected
   postmortem across the lifespan. This descriptive work is complemented
   by a discovery-based approach in genetically engineered mice and cell
   culture systems, aimed at novel chromatin-associated mechanisms
   governing the brain's cognitive and affective states.

   Research Projects and Experimental Approaches

   We explore epigenetic regulation of gene expression, in order to
   identify epigenetic drug targets and novel treatment avenues for
   psychosis, depression and other psychiatric disease.
