   Ubiquitin Signaling in Cancer Biology

    Post-doctoral Fellows: Kenneth Wu and Xinson Xu

   Graduate Student: Jordan Kovacev


   Covalent linkage of ubiquitin chains to cellular proteins leads to
   targeted degradation by the 26S proteasome, thus promoting
   unidirectional alteration of a divergent array of cellular processes
   that include cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and tumor
   suppression.


   Central to the ubiquitination reaction are the recognition of a
   substrate by an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, which also functions to
   recruit an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that catalyzes the transfer
   of ubiquitin to the target protein. Work from this laboratory has
   helped uncovering a super-family of cullin-ROC1 RING based E3 ligases.
   We are focusing on SCF, the prototype of cullin-RING E3, with specific
   interest to understand the mechanisms by which it targets protein
   substrates for polyubiquitination and eventual proteasomal
   degradation.  Given its broad spectrum of protein targets, the SCF
   pathway profoundly impacts a wide range of biological processes,
   including cell growth and death, development, signal transduction,
   transcriptional control, genomic integrity, and tumor suppression.


   We have discovered an SCF-like E3 ligase complex containing CUL7, Fbw8,
   Skp1 and ROC1. Dysregulation of the CUL7 E3 Ligase has been directly
   linked to hereditary human diseases as cul7 germline mutations were
   found in patients with autosomal-recessive 3-M and Yakuts short stature
   syndromes, which are characterized by profound pre- and postnatal
   growth retardation. Recently, we have identified insulin receptor
   substrate 1, a critical mediator of insulin and insulin-like growth
   factor-1 signaling, as the proteolytic target of the CUL7 E3 ligase,
   suggesting a role for CUL7 as a novel growth regulator. We are
   currently exploring pathomechanistic insights into CUL7-linked growth
   retardation syndromes.
