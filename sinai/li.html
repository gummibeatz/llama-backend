   Epigenetic regulation in stem cells and human diseases.

   Â Â Â  Our research is focused on genomic imprinting. We are analyzing
   the acquisition and maintenance of genomic DNA methylation imprints in
   mouse as well as in ES and iPS cells. We are also applying our Zfp57
   knockout mouse to modeling of imprinting related complex human diseases
   such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.

   Genomic imprinting in stem cells

   Â Â Â  Genomic imprinting is essential for mammalian development.
   Consistent with this, a majority of cloned embryos die in utero, mainly
   from the failure to re-establish proper genomic imprints. Cell-based
   therapies offer great hopes for various degenerative diseases,
   including Alzheimerâs disease and diabetes. Embryonic stem (ES) cells
   derived from nuclear transfer experiments and induced pluripotent stem
   (iPS) cells reprogrammed from adult cells are candidates for this
   therapeutic approach. However, they all have genomic imprinting defects
   which can inhibit differentiation and may even cause cancer. Recently,
   it was reported that dysregulation of the Dlk1-Dio3 imprinted domain is
   the only notable difference between ES cells and iPS cells (Stadtfeld,
   M. et al. Nature, 2010). Indeed, hypermethylation and aberrant
   expression of the imprinted genes were observed at the Dlk1-Dio3
   imprinted region in iPS cells Therefore, it is important to know how to
   manipulate the genomic imprinting machinery in pluripotent stem cells
   including iPS and ntES cells so that proper development of different
   lineages of cells can be achieved for therapeutic applications.Â

   Â Â Â  The current major focus of our lab is to analyze acquisition and
   maintenance of genomic imprinting in stem cells as well as in mouse
   embryos. Recently, we discovered that Zfp57 is highly enriched in ES
   cells and is a key regulator in genomic imprinting at multiple
   imprinted regions including the Dlk1-Dio3 domain. Loss of Zfp57 results
   in loss of DNA methylation genomic imprints at these imprinted regions.
   Consistent with our finding, mutations in human Zfp57 result in
   hypomethylation at multiple imprinted regions. Currently we are
   actively investigating the underlying mechanisms of ZFP57-associated
   complexes in the acquisition and maintenance of DNA methylation
   imprints in both mouse embryos and ES cells.

   Mechanisms in genomic imprinting

   Â Â Â  Despite that genomic imprinting was identified in mammals almost
   three decades ago, many unanswered questions persist about the nature
   of genomic imprinting memory and about how genomic imprints are
   established and maintained. Zfp57 has both maternal and zygotic
   functions and it exhibits maternal-zygotic embryonic lethality, the
   first one identified in mammals. ZFP57 maintains both paternal and
   maternal genomic imprints and may target DNA methyltransferases to the
   imprinting control regions (ICR). Interestingly, these germline-derived
   differential DNA methylation imprints at the ICRs can be lost in
   embryos in the absence of both maternal and zygotic Zfp57 and they can
   be acquired in mouse embryos in the presence of zygotic Zfp57 even
   though they are not established in the germline. Moreover, acquisition
   of DNA methylation in mouse embryos occurs in an allele-specific
   fashion, suggesting the presence of DNA methylation-independent
   heritable imprinting memory such as heritable histone modifications.
   Therefore, further functional analysis of ZFP57 in genomic imprinting
   will help us to achieve a better understanding of the molecular nature
   of imprinting memory as well as the temporal and developmental control
   of DNA methylation imprints.

   Modeling complex human diseases

   Â Â Â  Dysregulation of imprinting genes can lead to cancer,
   neurological diseases, diabetes and other kinds of human diseases.
   Indeed, mutations in human ZFP57 are associated with transient neonatal
   diabetes, congenital heart defects and abnormal development of the
   nervous system. We have independently discovered that Zfp57 mutant
   mouse is obese and display similar defects in the cardiovascular
   system. Thus, our Zfp57 mutant mouse could serve as useful animal
   models for complex human diseases such as obesity, diabetes and
   cardiovascular diseases.

   Figure 2.Â ZFP57 is involved in the acquisition, maintenance and
   re-acquisition of DNA methylation genomic imprints. Paternal
   chromosomes are indicated by blue lines. IG, IG-DMR. SN, Snrpn DMR.

   Differential DNA methylation at the CpG sites of imprinting control
   regions (ICR) is reset during gametogenesis. In sperm, the CpG sites at
   the IG-DMR (IG) of the Dlk1-Dio3 imprinted domain are methylated while
   those at the Snrpn DMR (SN) are unmethylated. By contrast, methylation
   occurs at the Snrpn DMR but not at the IG-DMR in the ooytes derived
   from wild-type females. Upon fertilization, differential methylation is
   reconstituted at the ICRs in the wild-type zygote (Zygote (1)). These
   germline-derived differential DNA methylation imprints are resistant to
   genome-wide pronuclear demethylation in the zygote and stably
   maintained in wild-type embryos. Without zygotic ZFP57, differential
   DNA methylation is partially lost in the zygotic mutant embryos around
   mid-gestation (Midgestation Embryo (A)). When both maternal and zygotic
   ZFP57 are absent, differential DNA methylation is completely missing in
   the mid-gestation maternal-zygotic mutant embryos (Midgestation Embryo
   (B)). Without maternal ZFP57, DNA methylation is not established at the
   CpG sites of the Snrpn DMR in the oocytes derived from Zfp57 homozygous
   female mice. In pre-implantation embryos lacking maternal ZFP57 (Zygote
   (2)), differential DNA methylation at the Snrpn DMR remains absent.
   Intriguingly, differential DNA methylation is re-acquired
   allele-specifically at the maternal chromosome of the Snrpn DMR in the
   presence of the zygotic ZFP57 in about 50% of the heterozygous embryos
   derived from null female mice (Li et al., 2008).
