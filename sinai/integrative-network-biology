   The explosion of large-scale, high-throughput technologies in the
   biological sciences demands a comprehensive view of biological
   systems.   Dr. Zhu's research focuses on:

   1.     Method development in integrating diverse high-throughput data
   into probabilistic causal network models.  There are multiple risk
   factors as well as their interactions contributing to complex human
   diseases, such genetic background, infection, environmental states,
   life-style choices, and etc.   It is critical to integrate all these
   factors into comprehensive disease networks which provide a context to
   understand mechanism of diseases and to study effects of genetic
   perturbations, drug perturbations, and their interactions.  Dr. Zhu's
   group has developed many methods for integrating genetic and genomic
   data into Bayesian networks:

   2.     Method development in comparing multiple networks.  There are
   multiple risk/perturbation factors driving a biological system from a
   healthy state to a disease state.  In response, there are hundreds to
   thousands genes changed at transcription or protein levels.  Dr. Zhu's
   works showed that instead of monitoring changes in a few genes, it is
   more robust to monitor changes of network states or structures when
   studying complex diseases:

   3.     Method development in analyzing biological networks.  If
   comprehensive biological networks are available, how to convert network
   knowledge into actionable items?  For example in drug discovery and
   development, we investigated which nodes and node combinations in the
   networks can generate largest beneficial effects when perturbed.  In
   biomarker research, we examined which parts of networks can robustly
   connect to drug response, disease progression and survivals.
