   Can we change our emotions? Our lab is interested in discovering the
   neural mechanisms underlying emotional control and flexibility. Because
   the environment we live in is constantly changing, we need to
   continuously update our emotional responses. In extreme situations,
   when emotional memories become traumatic, we might even wish to 'erase'
   emotional memories altogether. Our research team uses neuroimaging,
   pharmacology and psychophysiology to understand the neural mechanisms
   that make such emotional flexibility. We examine emotional processing
   in the normal brain and in patients with anxiety disorders, and hope to
   promote new forms of treatment.
