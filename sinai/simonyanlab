   Our main research focus is on elucidation of the pathophysiology of
   primary dystonia through the investigations of its neuroimaging,
   neuropathological, clinical, genetic andÂ environmental correlates. We
   are also interested in comparisons of imaging features of dystonia with
   other movement disorders, such as essential tremorÂ and Parkinsonâs
   disease.Â

   Our recent research direction includes studies on functional and
   structural connectome of high frequency networks in epilepsy.Â

   Using multi-disciplinary approach and novel technologies, we are
   developing a better understanding of normal and diseased states of the
   central nervous system, which will ultimately help develop new
   therapeutic options for patients with movement disorders and epilepsy.
