   Our lab studies the neural mechanisms of memory in the everyday sense
   of the word: the ability to learn new facts and remember recent events.
   Although for many years scientists believed that only one form of
   learning existed in the brain, we now know that different brain
   networks are crucial for different types of learning. For example, the
   hippocampus is needed to learn and remember new facts and recent
   events, the amygdala is crucial for earning emotional associations, and
   the neostriatum is required for certain forms of skill learning. My
   research focuses on how the hippocampus, refrontal cortex, and other
   brain areas contribute to memory in experimental animals, mostly rats,
   and how mechanisms of neuronal plasticity within these structures
   contribute to memory functions. Experiments in my lab are guided by
   cognitive, computational, physiological, and pharmacological
   hypotheses.
   The basic idea is that the properties of the NMDA receptor allows cells
   in the hippocampus to conjoin temporally overlapping cortical inputs
   into representations of events, and that recurrent connections within
   the hippocampus and between it and other structures allow these events
   to be linked into the sequences that comprise episodic memories.
   Interactions between the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex allow
   specific memories to guide response rules, and different strategies and
   motives allow the prefrontal cortex to select among memories in
   otherwise identical situations. Experiments investigating the links
   between these different levels of analysis are aimed toward providing
   an integrated perspective of memory.
