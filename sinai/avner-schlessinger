   Dr. Schlessinger is an Assistant Professor in the Department of
   Pharmacology and Systems Therapeutics, and is a member of the Tisch
   Cancer Institute, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New
   York City. The overall goal of Dr. Schlessingerâs lab is to improve and
   automate the structure-based discovery process by developing and
   applying novel computational approaches, and to collaborate with
   experimental labs to characterize pharmacologically important proteins,
   with a long-term goal of developing cancer drugs. His lab publishes in
   the areas of structural biology, bioinformatics, and drug discovery, as
   well as in personalized medicine and pharmacogenetics. Dr. Schlessinger
   graduated from Tel Aviv University with a B.Sc. in Chemistry and
   Biology, and completed his Ph.D. from Columbia University in the
   Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics. Following his
   graduate studies, Dr. Schlessinger was an NIH NRSA postdoctoral fellow
   at the Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences,
   University of California San Francisco (UCSF), where he developed
   methods for protein structure prediction and structure-based drug
   design. Dr. Schlessinger is an Associate Editor of PLOS Computational
   Biology. Dr. Schlessinger joined the faculty at the Icahn School of
   Medicine at Mount Sinai in January, 2013.

   Our lab focuses on the development and application of computational
   tools to annotate the functions of proteins. The two major research
   areas of our group include:

   1. Structure-based drug design for membrane transporters. Our group
   characterizes cancer-related membrane transporter proteins, using a
   structure-based discovery approach, including homology modeling and
   virtual ligand screening, in collaboration with experimental labs. We
   rationally design novel chemical tools to study transportersâ role in
   cancer metabolism pathways, with a long-term goal of developing drugs
   against these potential cancer drug targets.

   2. Structural bioinformatics. The lab works on developing and applying
   sequence-based and structure-based methods to predict different
   features of proteins using various machine-learning techniques. We
   analyze the predicted features of proteins in the context of networks
   and proteomes, to characterize protein functions.

   Physicians and scientists on the faculty of the Icahn School of
   Medicine at Mount Sinai often interact with pharmaceutical, device and
   biotechnology companies to improve patient care, develop new therapies
   and achieve scientific breakthroughs. In order to promote an ethical
   and transparent environment for conducting research, providing clinical
   care and teaching, Mount Sinai requires that salaried faculty inform
   the School of their relationships with such companies.

   Dr. Schlessinger did not report having any of the following types of
   financial relationships with industry during 2014 and/or 2015:
   consulting, scientific advisory board, industry-sponsored lectures,
   service on Board of Directors, participation on industry-sponsored
   committees, equity ownership valued at greater than 5% of a publicly
   traded company or any value in a privately held company. Please note
   that this information may differ from information posted on corporate
   sites due to timing or classification differences.

   Mount Sinai's faculty policies relating to faculty collaboration with
   industry are posted on our website. Patients may wish to ask their
   physician about the activities they perform for companies.
