   Dr. Kundu's research is focused on the development and application of
   advanced neuroimaging and functional MRI (fMRI) techniques towards the
   study of healthy and pathological brain function. As the Chief of the
   Image Analysis Core, Dr. Kundu implements neuroimaging analysis
   workflows and collaborative analysis platforms to make cutting-edge
   functional and structural imaging techniques more accessible to
   researchers across disciplines including psychiatry, neurology, and
   genomics. As Chief of the Advanced Functional Neuroimaging Section, Dr.
   Kundu develops fMRI acquisition and analysis approaches that are robust
   to the numerous sources of artifact in fMRI data (motion,
   cardiopulmonary physiology, equipment) while remaining highly sensitive
   to brain activity from neuropsychological tasks, the "resting state",
   and pharmacological challenges, in humans and animals. Altogether, Dr.
   Kundu's efforts target the in vivo characterization of neurobiological
   processes and the development of clinical neuroimaging biomarkers of
   neuropsychiatric disease using a collaborative approach.
