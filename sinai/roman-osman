   DNA Damage and Repair

   The long-term goal of this project is to develop a molecular
   understanding, derived from a combined theoretical-experimental
   collaborative approach, of the principles of specific DNA damage
   recognition and repair. The collaboration is between this laboratory
   and that of J. B. Alexander Ross.

   Two mechanisms of damage repair are important for the maintenance of
   the genetic material encoded in DNA. One is the excision of the damage
   followed by a restoration of the correct DNA sequence in a number of
   coordinated steps represented by the Base Excision Pathway (BER). The
   other repair process is accomplished by an error-free translesion
   synthesis. We study the mechanism of damage recognition and its
   excision by two repair enzymes: Endonuclease V (endoV) recognizes a
   thymine dimer (TD) and flips the complementary adenine to the 5-thymine
   of the TD into a protein pocket before hydrolyzing the glycosidic bond
   of the TD. Uracil DNA Glycosylase (UDG) recognizes uracil in DNA, flips
   it into a specific pocket and hydrolyzes the glycosidic bond. It
   appears that the mechanism of base flipping is universal to base
   excision repair. Thus, this project concentrates on understanding the
   molecular, energetic and kinetic elements that differentiate base
   flipping in damaged from undamaged DNA.
   Specificity of enzymes is determined not only by the recognition event,
   but also by the catalytic mechanism. The enzymatic catalysis of BER
   enzymes begins with a glycosylase step. The ionization states of
   several groups in the active sites of endoV or UDG are important for
   catalysis. We have computed the pKa values of the amino acids in the
   active site of endoV and on this basis we propose a catalytic mechanism
   of the glycosylase step in the enzyme (Fuxreiter, M. Warshel, A. Osman,
   R. The role of active site residues in the glycosylase step of T4
   endonuclease V. Computer simulation studies on ionization states.
   Biochemistry, 38:9577-9589,1999). We have studied by MD simulations the
   reactant and product states of UDG in complex with its substrate and on
   the basis of structural, electrostatic and dynamic changes we propose a
   mechanism of catalysis for the enzyme (Luo, N. Mehler, E. Osman, R.

   dynamics study of reactant and product complexes with DNA.

   Physicians and scientists on the faculty of the Icahn School of
   Medicine at Mount Sinai often interact with pharmaceutical, device and
   biotechnology companies to improve patient care, develop new therapies
   and achieve scientific breakthroughs. In order to promote an ethical
   and transparent environment for conducting research, providing clinical
   care and teaching, Mount Sinai requires that salaried faculty inform
   the School of their relationships with such companies.

   Dr. Osman did not report having any of the following types of financial
   relationships with industry during 2014 and/or 2015: consulting,
   scientific advisory board, industry-sponsored lectures, service on
   Board of Directors, participation on industry-sponsored committees,
   equity ownership valued at greater than 5% of a publicly traded company
   or any value in a privately held company. Please note that this
   information may differ from information posted on corporate sites due
   to timing or classification differences.

   Mount Sinai's faculty policies relating to faculty collaboration with
   industry are posted on our website. Patients may wish to ask their
   physician about the activities they perform for companies.
