   The Nanomedicine Laboratory (Nano-TMII) resides within the
   Translational and Molecular Imaging Institute at the Icahn School of
   Medicine at Mount Sinai.

   Nano-TMII's mission is to develop and advance nanomedicinal approaches
   to allow a better understanding, identification and treatment of the
   most detrimental pathologies today: cardiovascular disease and cancer.
   The research projects range from fundamental, including
   nanotechnologies to better understand lipoprotein biology, to
   translational, with one of the developed nanotherapies being in
   clinical trials: http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01601106

   Nano-TMII is directed by Dr. Willem Mulder. He is an Associate
   Professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and a
   Professor of Cardiovascular Nanomedicine at the Academic Medical Center
   of the University of Amsterdam. Nano-TMII's research is funded by the
   National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, the National Cancer Institute
   and NHLBIâs Program of Excellence in Nanotechnology as well as the
   Dutch Science Foundation (NWO).
