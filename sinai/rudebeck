    In our daily lives we often encounter both pleasurable and aversive
   situations, which heighten our emotional state and affect cognition.
   The ability to flexibly regulate our emotions in response to such
   events is essential for adapting to our environment and, ultimately,
   for our mental health. Many forms of mental illness involve dysfunction
   in the neural systems that regulate affective processing and decision
   making. The limbic system, which includes parts of the prefrontal
   cortex and medial temporal lobe, is critical for regulating emotions
   and plays an essential role in cognition. The main focus of the
   Rudebeck lab is to understand how interaction between the prefrontal
   cortex and subcortical structures such as the amygdala contribute to
   emotional regulation and decision-making. To do this, we use a
   combination of behavioral, autonomic, neurophysiological and
   interference methods in animal models.

   The Orbitofrontal Oracle: Cortical Mechanisms for the Prediction and
   Evaluation of Specific Behavioral Outcomes.
   The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has long been associated with the
   flexible control of behavior and concepts such as behavioral
   inhibition, self-control, and emotional regulation. These ideas
   emphasize the suppression of behaviors and emotions, but OFC's
   affirmative functions have remained enigmatic. Here we review recent
   work that has advanced our understanding of this prefrontal area and
   how its functions are shaped through interaction with subcortical
   structures such as the amygdala. Recent findings have overturned
   theories emphasizing behavioral inhibition as OFC's fundamental
   function. Instead, new findings indicate that OFC provides predictions
   about specific outcomes associated with stimuli, choices, and actions,
   especially their moment-to-moment value based on current internal
   states. OFC function thereby encompasses a broad representation or
   model of an individual's sensory milieu and potential actions, along
   with their relationship to likely behavioral outcomes.
