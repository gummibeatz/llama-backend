    Our research focuses on the analysis of human genetic variation to
   address fundamental questions in biology, medicine and anthropology. We
   are interested in detecting patterns of demography in genomic data to
   inform our inference of human evolution and history, and result in
   better outcomes for medical genomics. We combine population genetics
   theory, complex disease mapping, statistical modeling and
   experimentation to gain a deeper understanding of the landscape of
   genetic variation in global populations and its impact on function,
   fitness and adaptation. A detailed description of current projects can
   be found here.
