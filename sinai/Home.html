   We are interested in unusual mechanisms involved in regulating gene
   expression. Recently, we have been developing approaches to studying
   epigenetic regulation at the scale of the entire human genome.
   Elucidation of epigenetic mechanisms is essential to normal development
   and disease. Some of our recent discoveries may help in elucidating
   complex heritable disorders.

   Are there yet uncovered mechanisms impacting gene regulation which can
   be discovered through genome-scale approaches?

   What gives individual cells their identities?

   How unique are individual cells?

   These questions (and others) have been approached in studies of various
   species including Humans, mice and the fruit fly, Drosophila
   melanogaster.

   More information will be available on this site soon..... in the
   meantime, some further descriptions can be found ....here.

   Andrew Chess is at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in the Department of
   Developmental and Regenerative Biology, the Department of Neuroscience,
   and the Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences. We are also part
   of the Friedman Brain Insitute. The lab is located on the 25th floor of
   the Annenberg Research Building.
