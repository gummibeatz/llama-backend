   Dr. DeVita is a Professor in the Departments of Pharmacology and
   Systems Therapeutics and Structural and Chemical Biology and the
   Director of the Medicinal Chemistry Core of the Experimental
   Therapeutics Institute (ETI).  Prior to joining Mt Sinai, Dr. DeVita
   gained expertise managing multi-disciplinary teams that delivered on
   key program objectives for complex molecular targets.  He has over 25
   years working in biotech and the pharmaceutical industry, including at
   Merck Research Laboratories where he was a director of medicinal
   chemistry. His work has spanned the drug discovery paradigm from target
   ID to PII, including leadership of drug development teams. In
   collaboration with multi-disciplinary teams, he has identified multiple
   development candidates including two PII clinical compounds for CNS and
   CV targets.  Dr. DeVita has drug discovery experience within a broad
   range of therapeutic areas including: CNS, pain/inflammation, diabetes,
   cardiovascular, hypertension, obesity, endocrinology, urology and
   oncology.  He has developed, in collaboration with his teams, orally
   active, brain penetrant, peripheral and GI tract drug targeting
   strategies.   He also has experience in the discovery and development
   of PET imaging agents and translational biomarkers for CNS targets.

   Dr. DeVita has been an active member of the Medicinal Chemistry
   Division of the American Chemical Society serving on the Long Range
   Planning Committee and on the organizing committees for National and
   International Medicinal Chemistry Meetings. He has served as an Ad Hoc
   Reviewer for the National Institutes of Health Study Section for
   Synthetic and Biological Chemistry (Section B).

   Drug discovery target identification and validation to meet the needs
   of patients has become even more challenging in spite of the huge
   amounts of genomic and metabolomic data available today.  Close
   collaboration between biological and chemical sciences is vital to
   determine biological mechanisms of disease and to discover approaches
   to positively impact the disease state through intervention using
   molecular therapeutics. The research program of our laboratory is to
   develop novel chemical and biological tools in collaboration with our
   colleagues across the wide variety of therapeutic areas of interest to
   the Mount Sinai Research Community.  Targets meeting sufficient
   criteria of validation have the opportunity to enter into the drug
   discovery portfolio of the Experimental Therapeutics Institute.

   The DeVita Laboratory supports many drug discovery and development
   activities including:

   -      evaluation of high throughput and virtual screens

   -      hit validation and follow-up

   -      lead identification

   -     chemical tools for in vivo studies in preclinical animal models
   of disease

   -  lead optimization with the eventual goal of  identification of
   candidates for clinical studies.

   In addition, an important focus of the laboratory is to develop key
   chemical and biochemical tools necessary to create translational and
   target engagement biomarkers, including imaging agents, to further
   understand the impact on disease states and underlying biology to
   effectively intervene in the designated disease pathway.

   The laboratory works toward the identification of novel chemical matter
   by developing new chemical processes and syntheses in the areas of
   heterocyclic chemistry and carbon-carbon bond forming reactions to
   access unexploited chemical space.

   Physicians and scientists on the faculty of the Icahn School of
   Medicine at Mount Sinai often interact with pharmaceutical, device and
   biotechnology companies to improve patient care, develop new therapies
   and achieve scientific breakthroughs. In order to promote an ethical
   and transparent environment for conducting research, providing clinical
   care and teaching, Mount Sinai requires that salaried faculty inform
   the School of their relationships with such companies.

   Below are financial relationships with industry reported by Dr. DeVita
   during 2014 and/or 2015. Please note that this information may differ
   from information posted on corporate sites due to timing or
   classification differences.

   Mount Sinai's faculty policies relating to faculty collaboration with
   industry are posted on our website. Patients may wish to ask their
   physician about the activities they perform for companies.
