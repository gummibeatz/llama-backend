   Sadler Lab - Research

   Overview.

   Â Â Â  The liver accomplishes an amazing array of physiological tasks,
   including energy homeostasis, xenobiotic metabolism, serum protein
   secretion and bile production. Despite the remarkable regenerative
   capacity of the liver, it is not always able to undergo efficient
   repair, and diseases of the liver are common. Our lab uses zebrafish to
   understand liver development and disease.

   The role of uhrf1 in liver development.

   hepatocyte-specific probe.

   Figure 2. The liver is small in 4 day embryos that lack uhrf1. uhrf1
   morphants (bottom 4 larvae) expressing GFP in hepatocytes have small
   livers and developmental defects compared to controls (top)

   Is uhrf1 an oncogene?

   Â Â Â  Our experiments demonstrate that uhrf1 is required for liver
   growth under physiologic conditions. Our next question is to determine
   whether high levels of uhrf1 contribute to unregulated hepatocyte
   proliferation, as is found in hepatocellular carcinoma. To address this
   question, we collaborate with the Mount Sinai Liver Cancer Research
   Program directed by Dr. Josep Llovet. We have found that UHRF1 is
   highly expressed in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,
   and studies are underway to establish the significance of this finding.

   How does uhrf1 function to regulate hepatocyte proliferation?

   Â Â Â  Recent, exciting data indicates that a primary role of Uhrf1 in
   mammals is to direct DNA methyl transferase (DNMT1) to hemi-methylated
   DNA during replication. UHRF1 is required for maintaining DNA
   methylation and loss of UHRF1 causes significant changes in
   methylation. Our working model is that zebrafish with depleted uhrf1
   fail to undergo methylation-mediated silencing of genes which halt the
   cell cycle (i.e. tumor suppressors). Currently, work in the lab is
   focused on identifying potential important uhrf1 target genes.

   How is Uhrf1 regulated?

   The genetics of fatty liver disease

   Fatty liver disease is most frequently associated with obesity or
   alcohol abuse, and a range from fat accumulating in hepatocytes
   (steatosis) to the severe steatohepatitis fall under the umbrella of
   this disease. We are using zebrafish genetics to understand the factors
   that contribute to steatosis.

   Alcoholic liver disease

   larvae.

   Metabolic liver disease

   Figure 5. fgr mutants have hepatomegaly (top) and defective hepatocytes
   which do not store glycogen (bottom).

   The fgr gene is highly conserved in animals, and the Fgr protein does
   not have any known function. Efforts are underway to determine the
   cellular function of Fgr and to elucidate the mechanism by which
   mutation of this novel gene gives rise to steatosis.Â

   Â Â Â  We find that fgr mutants have defects in protein secretion,
   activation of the unfolded protein response and hepatic endoplasmic
   reticulum (ER) stress. Current work is focused on determining how
   disruption of the secretory pathway and ER stress causes steatosis.
