   In the past 30 years the use of fluorescence imaging in biological
   sciences has been as important as DNA-based methods advancing our
   understanding in almost every field. (Nobel Prizes for GFP (2008) and
   super resolution imaging (2014) are testament to this.) My work during
   this period has pioneered the use of light to control cell function,
   the optical tools we have made have proved to be conceptual fundamental
   enabling technologies. Specifically I have developed caged calcium
   probes, which have enabled 100s of experiments in many areas of biology
   and chemistry. The second focus of my research is the development of
   caged neurotransmitters. We have published several seminal papers in
   this field. These probes have also enabled many important discoveries
   by many neuroscientists all over the world. The goal of my current and
   future work is to be equally transformative. Thus my research at Mount
   Sinai has involved developing new probes that allow chromatically
   selective, multi-color stimulation of cellular processes. With our
   recent work we have taken optical stimulation of cells out of the
   "monochrome era" so as to enable bi-directional control of neuronal
   signaling with different colors of light for the first time.

   My lab uses organic chemistry to develop new optical methods for cell
   physiology.
