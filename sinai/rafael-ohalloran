   As Chief of the Image Acquisition Core, Dr. O'Halloran's work is
   focused on bringing innovative new imaging techniques to bear on
   problems in basic and clinical research. His primary area of focus is
   on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), in particular on high-resolution
   DWI. At high spatial resolution, DWI allows visualization of the white
   matter pathways that connect functional areas of the brain. One
   application of this technique that Dr. O'Halloran is focused on is in
   the planning of deep brain stimulation surgery to treat conditions such
   as Parkinson's disease, dystonia, and depression. Dr. O'Halloran's
   other interests include image reconstruction and motion correction.
   Patient motion continues to be a major problem in MRI, causing failed
   or prolonged exams which ultimately results in increased heath care
   costs. Solutions to patient motion can be implemented on both the
   acquisition and image reconstruction side, and can potentially benefit
   a wide range of MR imaging techniques.
