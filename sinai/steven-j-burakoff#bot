   Physicians and scientists on the faculty of the Icahn School of
   Medicine at Mount Sinai often interact with pharmaceutical, device and
   biotechnology companies to improve patient care, develop new therapies
   and achieve scientific breakthroughs. In order to promote an ethical
   and transparent environment for conducting research, providing clinical
   care and teaching, Mount Sinai requires that salaried faculty inform
   the School of their relationships with such companies.

   Below are financial relationships with industry reported by Dr.
   Burakoff during 2014 and/or 2015. Please note that this information may
   differ from information posted on corporate sites due to timing or
   classification differences.

   Scientific Advisory Board:

   Mount Sinai's faculty policies relating to faculty collaboration with
   industry are posted on our website. Patients may wish to ask their
   physician about the activities they perform for companies.

   Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) physicians - including those employed
   by MSHS - do not always participate in the same health plans in which
   MSHS hospitals or facilities participate.

   Information regarding insurance participation and billing by this
   physician may be found on this page or obtained by contacting this
   provider directly.

   Insurance plans that the Mount Sinai Health System hospitals or
   facilities participate in can be found on the Mount Sinai Health System
   website.
