   The Quantitative Body Imaging Group develops, tests and validates
   quantitative MR imaging techniques applied to body imaging. Our current
   research includes the optimization and validation of novel functional
   MRI techniques applied to diffuse and focal liver diseases, including
   diffusion-weighted MRI, dynamic contrast enhanced MRI, MR Elastography,
   flow quantification, spectroscopy and multi echo Dixon methods. We
   believe that these imaging modalities will provide non invasive
   information for:

   These techniques can be transposed to other organs, such as the
   kidneys, prostate and pancreas.
