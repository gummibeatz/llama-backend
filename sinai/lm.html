   Â Â Â The focus of our research is to understand the molecular and
   cellular nature of the undifferentiated stem cell "states", and how
   such states are altered during a change in cell fate. The underlying
   rationale for our studies is that the complement of gene-products and
   their inter-relationships that exist in stem cells accounts for their
   remarkable abilities to balance self-renewal and differentiation
   decision processes. We study both adult and embryonic stem (ES) cells,
   primarily from the mouse, but also from the human. As a first step, we
   have comprehensively identified most, if not all gene-products that are
   expressed in highly purified hematopoietic stem cell (HSC). We
   performed similar analyses in mouse ES cells. Such molecular
   "signatures" provide parts-lists that are available to the stem cells.
   The challenge has been to functionally address the roles that these
   molecules play in mediating the biological properties of HSC and ES
   cells. Further, we would like to understand how these molecular
   components are "wired" into regulatory signaling and transcriptional
   networks.

   Â Â Â To explore these issues we have utilized a number of global
   gene-expression perturbation technologies, such as inhibitory short
   hairpin RNA (shRNA). We have successfully down regulated the expression
   levels of candidate regulatory molecules in both HSC and ES cells. A
   number of these play crucial regulatory roles in processes such as
   self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation. We have further
   developed strategies that allow the analyses of cell-fate change
   dynamics at multiple biochemical and molecular levels in response to
   defined and precisely controlled changes in the expression levels of
   key regulatory molecules. These strategies have provided the first
   in-depth view of how a cell-fate decision actually occurs at the
   transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and
   post-translational levels. An important aspect of our overall efforts
   is computational and quantitative analyses. We anticipate that our
   approach will yield a systems biology level description and
   understanding of stem cell decision processes. This in turn, will have
   profound implications in future efforts focused on applying basic stem
   cell research in translational as well as clinical contexts.

   Â Â Â Â Â Â My research is focused on defining the cellular and
   molecular nature of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and the molecular
   cross-talk that occurs between stem cells and their niche. We use
   transgenic mouse models to study HSC during normal homeostasis and
   after stress. We are interested in the basic property of self-renewal
   and whether HSCs really do self-renew to full functional potential when
   they undergo cell division. The lab is also using specific factors to
   directly induce hemogenesis from somatic cells, both mouse and human.
   We have shown that the induction process recapitulates developmental
   hematopoies and molecular cues from these studies have led to a new
   investigation of HSC precursor populations during embryonic
   development. Overall our studies will have broad implications on the
   behavior of all stem cells including those that contribute to
   metastatic cancer and leukemias.Â
