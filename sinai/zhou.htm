   Ways to Give

   At the Experimental Therapeutics Institute, our goal is to exploit
   opportunities of new biological insights at the Icahn School of
   Medicine at Mount Sinai for novel therapeutics. We are creating a
   unique integrated academic drug discovery program that covers target
   discovery, validation in novel models and lead generation of both small
   molecules and biologics. We are a multi-disciplinary team and our broad
   capabilities range from state-of-the-art screening facilities,
   medicinal chemistry, induced pluripotent stem cells, rational design
   and monoclonal antibody development. Read more
