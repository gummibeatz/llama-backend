   Innovator Award from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

   Dr. Schaefer is an Assistant Professor of Neuroscience and Psychiatry
   and a Seaver Fellow at the Friedman Brain Institute at Mount Sinai
   School of Medicine. She did her graduate studies at the Johannes
   Gutenberg University Mainz, the Charit√© University Berlin and The
   Rockefeller University in New York. In the fall of 2004 she joined Dr.
   Paul Greengard's Laboratory at The Rockefeller University where she
   completed her postdoctoral studies and was promoted to Research
   Associate in 2007 and Senior Research Associate in 2009. She joined the
   Friedman Brain Institute at Mount Sinai School of Medicine to start her
   own laboratory in 2011. Her research is focused on understanding how
   epigenetic mechanisms contribute to maintenance of specialized neuronal
   functions and their alteration during psychiatric and neurodegenerative
   diseases.

   Anne Schaefer has been named a 2014 Kavli Frontiers of Science Fellow
   by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Kavli program honors
   young scientists who are considered leaders in their fields and have
   made significant contributions to science. Jointly sponsored by the US
   National Academy of Sciences and The Kavli Foundation, the Kavli
   Frontiers of Science bring together some of the very best young
   scientists (under age 45) to discuss exciting advances and
   opportunities in their fields in a format that encourages informal
   collective, as well as one-on-one discussions among participants. Dr.
   Schaefer was invited to the Japanese-American Frontiers of Science (
   JAFoS) Symposium that took place in Tokio in December 2014.

   Physicians and scientists on the faculty of the Icahn School of
   Medicine at Mount Sinai often interact with pharmaceutical, device and
   biotechnology companies to improve patient care, develop new therapies
   and achieve scientific breakthroughs. In order to promote an ethical
   and transparent environment for conducting research, providing clinical
   care and teaching, Mount Sinai requires that salaried faculty inform
   the School of their relationships with such companies.

   Dr. Schaefer did not report having any of the following types of
   financial relationships with industry during 2014 and/or 2015:
   consulting, scientific advisory board, industry-sponsored lectures,
   service on Board of Directors, participation on industry-sponsored
   committees, equity ownership valued at greater than 5% of a publicly
   traded company or any value in a privately held company. Please note
   that this information may differ from information posted on corporate
   sites due to timing or classification differences.

   Mount Sinai's faculty policies relating to faculty collaboration with
   industry are posted on our website. Patients may wish to ask their
   physician about the activities they perform for companies.
