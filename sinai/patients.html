   Even though individually rare, developmental disorders are common as a
   group: about 1 in 6 children in the U.S. were reported as having a
   developmental disability in the screening period of 2006-2008 (please
   visit the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).

   The Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDDs) we study include autism
   spectrum disorders (ASD), intellectual disability (ID) and epilepsy.

   We are dedicated to understanding the relationship between a personâs
   genes and neurodevelopmental disorders in order to help patients and
   families.

   Understanding the causes of these disorders may in the future improve
   the ability to diagnose and treat children with neurodevelopmental
   disorders.

   Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) â Autism Spectrum Disorders impact a
   childâs development in a number of ways: limited or unusual language
   and speech development limited or impaired social skills, and the
   presence of ritualistic or repetitive behaviors that often limit
   typical social development.

   Intellectual Disability (ID) â Intellectual Disability is characterized
   by significant limitations both in intellectual functioning and in
   adaptive behavior, which covers many everyday social and practical
   skills, starting before 18 years old.

   Epilepsy â 20 to 35 % of children with autism have seizures or develop
   epilepsy by the time they reach adulthood. In turn, individuals with
   new-onset epilepsy can experience developmental and cognitive delays.

   These conditions frequently overlap with one another, in addition to
   other NDDs and sometimes physical anomalies. There is very strong
   evidence that the same genetic variants can contribute to all three
   conditions, ASD, ID, and epilepsy. Patients with different clinical
   presentations within the NDDs spectrum can have mutations in the same
   gene, or in the same region that controls gene function. Although
   several genes have been identified for autism, and to a lesser extent
   for epilepsy, the etiology remains unknown in most affected
   individuals.

   We are interested in understanding how genetic changes can lead to the
   emergence and co-ocurrence of various NDDs. With a better understanding
   of the biological basis of NDDs, scientists and doctors can hope to
   bring families and patients more personalized care and effective
   treatment in the future.

   Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), such as developmental delay,
   autism, epilepsy, and intellectual disability are frequent in children
   and can have a genetic basis.
   We are interested in learning how genetic changes can affect brain
   development, and, subsequently, lead to disease. This study will
   examine similarities and differences in the genes of people with NDDs
   and their family members.

   NDDs can co-occur in the same family or the same person, suggesting
   that they may be caused by similar or related genetic changes. By
   mapping both shared and distinct changes we will better understand the
   biological basis of each disorder.

   Subjects and their family members will donate a blood sample, in the
   same way blood is drawn at a doctorâs office. All samples will be given
   an anonymous code number, and used only for research purposes. No names
   or personal information will be linked to the samples.

   In a large percentage of NDDs patients, the genetic changes have not
   yet been identified. This study will use your samples for research
   purposes only, meaning that what we learn from the analysis of an
   individual's sample has no direct benefit for the individual. However,
   by gathering information from many individuals, we hope to learn more
   about how changes affecting genes can lead to NDDs.

   The participation of many individuals with NDDs and their family
   members is the necessary foundation for making these discoveries.

   Children and young adults with a diagnosis of intellectual disability
   and/or autism spectrum disorders and/or epilepsy with unknown cause.

   Parents and family members of those with NDDs are eligible to
   participate whether or not they have NDDs. Research is usually more
   informative when both parents are enrolled in their childâs study.

   If you agree to participate, a questionnaire will be completed, you
   will participate in an interview, and donate a blood sample.

   Who is the research team?

   The Pinto laboratory is a research team led by Dr. Dalila Pinto. [GCO#
   12-1490, IRB approved through 11/20/15].

   We are located at the:

   Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai
   Department of Psychiatry
   Hess Center for Science and Medicine

   The Pinto Lab works in collaboration with the clinical departments of
   the Seaver Autism Center, the Mindich Child Health and Development
   Institute, the Epilepsy Centers at Mount Sinai, Beth Israel, Roosevelt
   and St. Luke's, and the division of Medical Genetics in order to
   adequately measure your childâs mental health through a range of
   gold-standard assessments.
