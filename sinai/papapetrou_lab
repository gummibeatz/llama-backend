    We use human pluripotent stem cells to understand the mechanisms of
   malignant and non-malignant genetic blood diseases and to develop new
   therapies. We are harnessing somatic cell reprogramming and genetic
   engineering technologies to develop new models of normal and abnormal
   hematopoiesis. By capturing and introducing disease-associated genetic
   mutations and large chromosomal deletions in patient-derived induced
   pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) we study their phenotypic and functional
   consequences, attempt to reconstruct the genetic history of leukemia
   progression and seek to identify new therapeutic targets through
   genetic and chemical screens.

   The Papapetrou lab is located at the Leon and Norma Hess Center for
