   PhD, University of South Florida

   Dr Hiotis is a Surgical Oncologist at the Mount Sinai School of
   Medicine. He received his MD degree from the University of Maryland,
   and also holds a PhD in Immunology. Dr Hiotis trained in General
   Surgery at the University of South Florida in Tampa, and in Surgical
   Oncology at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. He
   has a strong interest in cancers of the liver and gastrointestinal
   tract. In addition to clinical practice in surgical oncology, Dr Hiotis
   is currently actively engaged in both clinical and laboratory research.


   He is currently the principal investigator of an independently funded
   scientific research project, which focuses on the interaction between
   hepatic fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with
   hepatitis B. This project involves both a retrospective and prospective
   component. The prospective arm includes a tumor banking protocol, from
   which over 100 human tumor and non-neoplastic liver parenchymal
   specimens have already been collected and cryopreserved. This is a
   highly unique tumor bank, and only includes hepatocellular cancers from
   patients with hepatitis B. A broad spectrum of tumors have already been
   collected from patients with varying degrees of underlying hepatic
   fibrosis, which is a unique characteristic seen in patients with
   hepatitis B associated hepatocellular carcinoma. Dr Hiotisâ hepatitis
   B-hepatocellular carcinoma research project is designed to evaluate
   differences in hepatocellular carcinoma that arise in patients with
   underlying cirrhosis, vs. those cancers that arise instead in livers
   with minimal or moderate fibrosis. His additional research activities
   also include participation in clinical trials for treatment of liver
   and gastrointestinal cancers, and basic science research focusing on
   cancer immunotherapy in a mouse model for hepatocellular carcinoma.


   Dr.  Hiotis is currently the Vice Chairman for Surgical Research at
   Mount Sinai. In this role, Dr. Hiotis administrates the coordinated
   clinical and basic science research efforts of a large department,
   including ten divisions and multiple full-time faculty members. He
   supervises the departmentâs research fellows, coordinators, and
   assistants.

   In addition to his administrative responsibilities in research, Dr.
   Hiotis also maintains a research endeavor of his own, oversees a basic
   science laboratory, and is the principal investigator of
   independently-funded scientific research. He is also actively engaged
   in several clinical trials.

   His recent open protocols include:

   Physicians and scientists on the faculty of the Icahn School of
   Medicine at Mount Sinai often interact with pharmaceutical, device and
   biotechnology companies to improve patient care, develop new therapies
   and achieve scientific breakthroughs. In order to promote an ethical
   and transparent environment for conducting research, providing clinical
   care and teaching, Mount Sinai requires that salaried faculty inform
   the School of their relationships with such companies.

   Dr. Hiotis did not report having any of the following types of
   financial relationships with industry during 2014 and/or 2015:
   consulting, scientific advisory board, industry-sponsored lectures,
   service on Board of Directors, participation on industry-sponsored
   committees, equity ownership valued at greater than 5% of a publicly
   traded company or any value in a privately held company. Please note
   that this information may differ from information posted on corporate
   sites due to timing or classification differences.

   Mount Sinai's faculty policies relating to faculty collaboration with
   industry are posted on our website. Patients may wish to ask their
   physician about the activities they perform for companies.
