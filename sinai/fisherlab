   A Network in Control of Cell Division and Gene Expression

   How do cells decide when to divide and, having committed to that fate,
   how do they faithfully duplicate and segregate their contentsâincluding
   their DNA? Among the progeny of these divisions, which all carry the
   same genetic information, how are different programs of gene expression
   established and maintained? Our lab studies the regulation of both
   processesâcell division and gene expressionâby a network of
   cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). We take a chemical genetic approach,
   by expanding the ATP-binding pocket of a targeted CDK to accommodate
   bulky ATP analogsâboth inhibitors and substratesâthat cannot bind to
   the wild-type kinase (Figure). In multicellular organisms, cell-cycle
   and transcriptional CDK networks are linked by Cdk7, the CDK-activating
   kinase (CAK), which is also part of the general transcription factor
   TFIIH. We determined how Cdk7 coordinates its cell-cycle function with
   a second essential function during the transcription cycle of RNA
   polymerase (RNAP) II. Our studies reveal similarities of organization
   and regulatory logic between cell division and mRNA synthesis; both are
   cycles, in which checkpoints and surveillance systems enforce fidelity,
   directionality and irreversibility. By chemical genetic analysis of the
   CDK network we hope to define the precise roles and targets of specific
   CDK-cyclin complexes in cell-cycle and transcriptional regulation, and
   to identify potential vulnerabilities of cancer cells to specific CDK
   inhibitors.
