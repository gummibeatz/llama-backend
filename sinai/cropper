   What determines whether a change in the external environment evokes a
   motor response?
   We address this question in an experimentally advantageous preparation,
   the mollusc Aplysia. We study food-induced changes in biting that occur
   under some circumstances and not under others. We focus on forms of
   short term plasticity that are important in this context, and
   characterize them using electrophysiological, morphological,
   behavioral, and imaging techniques. Current projects focus on
   mechanisms that regulate spike propagation in sensory neurons and
   mechanisms that regulate the efficacy of synaptic transmission.
