Faculty Bio

   Agata Smogorzewska

   Throughout its lifetime, a cell's DNA is under constant metabolic and
   environmental assault leading to damage. Left unchecked, the resulting
   genome instability initiates cancer and other age-related disorders.
   Using Fanconi anemia as a backdrop for understanding aging and cancer,
   Dr. Smogorzewska's research aims to elucidate pathways that prevent
   cancer development, with a specific focus on those that repair DNA and
   those that induce permanent growth arrest in response to cellular
   stress.

   Fanconi anemia is a recessive syndrome characterized by developmental
   abnormalities, bone marrow failure and cancer predisposition. Unlike
   healthy individuals, patients with Fanconi anemia are extremely
   susceptible to DNA cross-linking agents such as cisplatin and mitomycin
   C (MMC). Dr. Smogorzewska uses this background to understand the
   cellular processes that repair DNA. In particular, her research aims to
   understand the regulation and activity of the proteins known to be
   mutated in the Fanconi anemia pathway; identify factors that promote
   survival in Fanconi anemia cells in the setting of cross-link damage;
   discover and mechanistically study new components of pathways
   responsible for MMC resistance in human cells; and study the mechanism
   of senescence induction in human cells and its involvement in tumor
   suppression and cancer treatment responses.

   Fanconi anemia patients are classified into 16 different
   complementation groups, with each group representing a mutation in one
   gene. While a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Smogorzewska discovered FANCI,
   one of the Fanconi anemia genes, using functional analysis of a
   proteomic screen that identified putative substrates of ATM and ATR,
   proteins that are key kinases involved in cellular responses to DNA
   damage. FANCI and FANCD2 are key components of the pathway, and they
   direct the effectors of the pathway to perform repair. One of these
   effectors is FAN1 (Fanconi anemia-associated nuclease 1), which Dr.
   Smogorzewska identified in a whole genome short hairpin RNA screen in
   human cells that was designed to identify genes that were important for
   survival after DNA cross-link damage. FAN1 localizes to the sites of
   damage using its ubiquitin-binding domain that interacts with
   monoubiquitinated FANCD2. In vitro, FAN1 has a nuclease activity, which
   is necessary for the resistance to DNA cross-link damage. It is now
   clear that FAN1 also has Fanconi anemia pathway-independent functions.
   Germline FAN1 mutations have been identified in karyomegalic
   interstitial nephritis, a chronic kidney disease; individuals with this
   disease lack Fanconi anemia phenotypes. The lab continues to study
   FAN1's role in cross-link repair in order to understand the
   pathophysiology of both diseases.

   Three more nucleases are implicated in cross-link repair, all of which
   interact with a single scaffold protein, SLX4. The Smogorzewska lab
   identified mutations in SLX4 in two patients from the International
   Fanconi Anemia Registry started at The Rockefeller University by Arleen
   Auerbach in 1982. These patients had typical clinical features of
   Fanconi anemia, including bone marrow failure and cancer
   predisposition. Using the cell lines from these patients, the lab
   showed that XPF was the essential nuclease in cross-link repair during
   S phase. The lab is continuing to study the genetic interactions
   between SLX4 and other repair pathways in the cell.

   Current research in the lab focuses on discovering other Fanconi genes
   using whole exome sequencing, studying the role of Fanconi anemia in
   stem cells, identifying and studying genetic changes underlying cancers
   in Fanconi anemia patients, and using mouse models to explore the role
   of FAN1. The ultimate goal of Dr. Smogorzewska's research is to
   understand how all of the components of the DNA interstrand cross-link
   repair pathway ensure genome stability during DNA replication, how they
   suppress cancer and how they protect vital organ function.

CAREER

   Dr. Smogorzewska received her B.S. in molecular biology and
   biochemistry from the University of Southern California in 1995, her
   Ph.D. from The Rockefeller University in 2002 and her M.D. from Weill
   Cornell Medical College in 2003. Following a residency in clinical
   pathology at Massachusetts General Hospital, she joined Harvard Medical
   School as a postdoctoral fellow in Stephen Elledge's lab in 2005. She
   joined The Rockefeller University as an assistant professor in 2009.

   Dr. Smogorzewska is the recipient of numerous awards, including the
   Pershing Square Sohn Prize in 2014, the Doris Duke Charitable
   Foundation Clinical Scientist Development Award in 2011, the Irma T.
   Hirschl Research Award and Rita Allen Foundation Scholars Program Grant
   in 2010, the Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Award for Medical
   Scientists in 2008 and the Harold M. Weintraub Graduate Student Award
   in 2002.

   Dr. Smogorzewska is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
