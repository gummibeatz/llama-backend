Faculty Bio

   Jeffrey Ravetch

   Dr. Ravetch dissects the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern
   the generation of antibody specificity and the translation of that
   specificity into cellular responses. By identifying the genetic
   components that cause immune system cells to respond to specific
   antibodies, Dr. Ravetch hopes to gain a better understanding of how a
   functioning immune system protects organisms from invaders, and how a
   dysfunctional immune system attacks the body's own tissues.

   The Ravetch laboratory analyzes systemic autoimmunity in mouse models
   of certain diseases by investigating the genesis and fate of the
   pathological antigen-antibody complexes that form and trigger tissue
   damage. They simplify this complex problem by examining the mechanisms
   through which immune complexes influence both the afferent and efferent
   immune responses by interacting with a family of low-affinity surface
   receptors, the Fc receptors. These receptors are expressed as pairs of
   activation and inhibitory molecules, providing a mechanism for
   establishing thresholds for cellular triggering and for terminating the
   activation response. Disruptions of these pathways have revealed the
   central role these receptors play in appropriate immune responses.

   Dr. Ravetch has shown that inhibitory Fc receptors for immunoglobulin G
   (IgG) are responsible for maintaining peripheral tolerance; animals
   without inhibitory Fc receptors develop spontaneous autoimmunity and
   autoimmune disease. Conversely, a deficiency of activation Fc receptors
   results in a protective effect, in which mice susceptible to autoimmune
   disease fail to develop it. But loss of activation receptors does not
   alter the development of autoantibody and immune complex deposition.
   Rather, Dr. Ravetch has found that these potentially pathogenic
   complexes are unable to trigger effector cell responses and are
   therefore benign. His lab is now investigating the precise cellular
   pathways engaged by activation receptors via autoantibodies by
   generating cell type-specific targeted gene disruptions of relevant
   activation receptors and by identifying the downstream effector
   molecules responsible. Recent work from the Ravetch lab showed that a
   sugar attached to IgG antibodies confers their protective ability; they
   are now working on a synthetic therapy rich in these sugar-linked
   antibodies.

   Another focus in the Ravetch lab is the circuits involved in
   coordinating the regulation of activation and inhibitory receptors, in
   order to determine the signals that shift the balance from inhibition
   to activation. He has demonstrated that removing the inhibitory pathway
   in vivo, for example, can dramatically increase the potency of a
   cytotoxic antitumor antibody. This was the first demonstration of
   antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity in vivo. Current studies are now
   aimed at manipulating the inhibitory response to enhance or limit the
   cytotoxicity of antibodies in vivo to better understand the role these
   pathways play in protective immunity and their therapeutic potential.

   The lab is also working to determine the pathways through which the
   coupling of innate and adaptive mechanisms are coordinated to initiate
   an immune response. Two such pathways are currently under
   investigation: the feedback by immune complexes on antigen presentation
   and the targeting of selected antigens to restricted follicular
   locations to initiate T cell independent responses. Using a series of
   mice deficient in specific Fc receptors and immune complexes designed
   to selectively engage these pathways, they are determining the role of
   each in activating or tolerizing presenting cells in vivo.

   Work by Dr. Ravetch led to the cloning and mapping of the first
   malarial parasite chromosome and more recently to the cloning of the
   first Fc receptor genes. He discovered how immunoglobulin receptors
   mediate antibody-triggered inflammation and determined the mechanism by
   which intravenous immunoglobulin causes immunosuppression. He also
   played a key role in establishing Fc receptor pathways as an essential
   part of the immune response and in describing the mechanisms of
   antibody-mediated effector responses.

CAREER

   Dr. Ravetch graduated from Yale University in 1973 and received his
   Ph.D. in 1978 from The Rockefeller University, where he studied under
   Norton Zinder and Peter Model. He received his M.D. from Cornell
   University Medical College in 1979 and completed his postdoctoral
   research at the National Institutes of Health with Philip Leder. In
   1982 Dr. Ravetch joined the faculty of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
   Center and in 1984 also became a guest investigator in Rockefeller's
   Laboratory of Cellular Physiology and Immunology. He was appointed
   professor at Rockefeller in 1996 and named Theresa and Eugene M. Lang
   Professor in 1997.

   Dr. Ravetch received the Canada Gairdner International Award and the
   Sanofi-Pasteur Award in 2012, the Coley Award from the Cancer Research
   Institute in 2007, the American Association of Immunologists-Huang
   Foundation Meritorious Career Award in 2005, the Lee C. Howley Sr.
   Prize for Arthritis Research in 2004 and the Burroughs Wellcome Fund
   Award in Molecular Parasitology in 1986. He is a fellow of the American
   Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Association for the
   Advancement of Science and a member of the National Academy of Sciences
   and the Institute of Medicine.

   Dr. Ravetch is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
