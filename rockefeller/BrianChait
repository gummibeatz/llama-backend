   Brian Chait

   Mass spectrometry is a powerful analytical technique that can
   accurately measure the molecular masses of individual biomolecules,
   including peptides, proteins and large intact protein assemblies. Dr.
   Chait's laboratory specializes in the development of mass spectrometers
   and other tools and methods for investigating a variety of biological
   and biochemical phenomena.

   Knowledge of the makeup, structure and dynamics of protein assemblies
   is key to understanding many cellular processes. A central focus of the
   Chait lab has been the development of novel mass spectrometers and
   biochemical tools, especially those based on quantitative mass
   spectrometry, for identifying and studying protein interactions and
   applying these tools to arrive at a functional definition of cellular
   protein assemblies. Recently, the laboratory has developed potent tools
   to elucidate proximal, distal and transient protein-protein
   interactions in cellular milieus as well as tools for determining
   distance restraints between amino acid residues within large protein
   assemblies by chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry. The
   long-term goal of this research is to develop a multiscale molecular
   microscope for defining cellular systems in which the scales span all
   the way from dimensions of the cell to atomic resolution of the
   molecular players.

   The Chait lab also serves as the National Resource for the Mass
   Spectrometric Analysis of Biological Macromolecules, now in its 41st
   year of funding from the National Institutes of Health. Its major areas
   of activity are basic research in mass spectrometry and ion chemistry.
   Work is currently under way in Dr. Chait's lab to develop novel tandem
   mass spectrometry (MS/MS) instrumentation for ultrasensitive, rapid and
   comprehensive characterization of proteins. Most MS/MS is inherently
   extremely wasteful, since, at any given time, all ion species except
   for the one that is specifically isolated are thrown away. The Chait
   lab is investigating new strategies for overcoming this inefficiency by
   capturing ions in novel high-capacity ion traps, in which they are
   cooled and sequentially ejected at increasing m/z ratios. Each of the
   ejected ions is fragmented, producing MS/MS information on all the
   trapped ion species without the usual scanning losses. The lab is also
   developing novel instrumentation for carrying out massively parallel
   mass spectrometry.

   Another aim of the lab is to develop new methods to study viral-host
   protein interactions during the progression of the highly dynamic viral
   infection. In particular, members of the Chait lab are developing
   techniques for simultaneously visualizing individual viral proteins in
   host cells and identifying their interacting macromolecular partners in
   space and time. Some of these techniques are already facilitating a
   greater understanding of both the molecular details of viral infections
   and the biology of the cell.

   In collaboration with Rockefeller's Nathaniel Heintz, work also is
   under way to unravel the molecular synaptic code in the mammalian
   brain. The formation of a functional brain requires several steps, from
   the generation of numerous types of neurons through the establishment
   of a very precise connectivity among those neurons. The Chait and
   Heintz labs aim to identify the composition of individual synapses from
   specific neuronal populations and compare those compositions with one
   another. They have developed methods that enable them to elucidate
   those different synaptic compositions.

   Most recently, they have developed new mass spectrometric techniques
   for defining repertoires of high-affinity antibodies that develop
   within humans (and llamas) against any given antigen, including
   endogenous human antibodies that are protective against HIV.

CAREER

   Dr. Chait received his B.Sc. in 1969 and his B.Sc. Hons. in 1970, both
   from the University of Cape Town in South Africa, and his D.Phil. in
   1976 from the University of Oxford. He did postdoctoral research at the
   University of Manitoba and joined Rockefeller in 1979 as a research
   associate in Frank H. Field's laboratory. He was appointed assistant
   professor in 1981, associate professor in 1985 and professor in 1991.
   In 1995, he was named the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Professor.

   His awards include the 2012 Pehr Edman Award, the 2007 HUPO Discovery
   Award in Proteomics Sciences, the 2002 Frank H. Field and Joe L.
   Franklin Award for Outstanding Achievement in Mass Spectrometry from
   the American Chemical Society, the 2000 Bijvoet Medal from Utrecht
   University and the 1998 American Association for the Advancement of
   Science Newcombe-Cleveland Prize. He has been awarded 25 United States
   patents for his inventions.

   Dr. Chait is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program, the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program and
   the Tri-Institutional Ph.D. Program in Chemical Biology.
