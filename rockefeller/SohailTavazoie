Faculty Bio

   Sohail Tavazoie

   Metastasis, the spread of cancer cells from a primary tumor to distal
   organs, accounts for the overwhelming majority of human deaths from
   solid cancers. Dr. Tavazoie's laboratory employs a systems biological
   approach that integrates molecular, cellular, animal and clinical
   observations to identify and characterize key molecular regulators of
   this complex process, with the ultimate goal of developing novel
   therapies aimed at its prevention and treatment.

   This year, over eight million people will die from cancer globally. For
   a large fraction of these individuals, the cause of death will be
   metastatic colonization of distant organs by cancer cells. While the
   impact of this process on human mortality has long been recognized, the
   molecular mechanisms that underlie cancer metastasis have only recently
   begun to be intensely studied. As is the case with developmental
   programs, metastatic progression by cancer cells requires the proper
   expression of effector genes that drive specific cellular and
   cell-biological phenotypes. Dr. Tavazoie is a cancer biologist and
   medical oncologist who is fundamentally interested in how such
   prometastatic gene expression programs are established in cancer cells,
   how they enable cancer cells to metastasize and how such programs
   emerge during cancer progression.

   Dr. Tavazoie's laboratory employs a combination of molecular, genomic,
   biochemical, genetic, imaging and computational approaches to study
   this process. These insights, combined with in vitro, in vivo, genetic
   and clinical association observations, are used to generate an
   integrated molecular and biological model of metastatic progression.
   This systematic approach has revealed that the acquisition of the
   metastatic phenotype by breast cancer cells requires the silencing of
   specific small noncoding RNAs (microRNAs). The silencing of these small
   RNAs leads to the enhanced expression of their target genes, which the
   lab identified to be promoters of metastatic phenotypes. Dr. Tavazoie's
   lab has generalized their findings to other prevalent cancers arising
   from distinct developmental lineages such as melanoma and colorectal
   cancer and have found that in these cancers, modulated expression of
   tissue-specific sets of small RNAs achieve enhanced metastatic
   outcomes. By experimentally modulating these metastasis regulatory
   microRNAs, the metastatic activity of cancer cells can be strongly
   impacted. Importantly, the expression levels of these specific
   microRNAs and their target genes in human cancer specimens support
   their functionally implicated roles in cancer.

   The use of these microRNAs as molecular probes has enabled Dr. Tavazoie
   to very efficiently uncover the cellular phenotypes they control and to
   implicate their downstream target genes and pathways as novel effectors
   of metastatic progression. His lab has established mouse metastasis
   systems that model the progression of prevalent human cancers, such as
   triple negative breast cancer, melanoma and colorectal cancer. These
   cancers were chosen because as a whole, they impact an exceedingly
   large number of patients globally; effective targeted therapies that
   prevent metastatic progression by these malignancies do not exist; and
   their derivation from three distinct developmental lineages makes it
   possible to determine how cells from diverse tissue origins achieve
   common phenotypic outcomes. To ensure the generality of their
   conclusions, Dr. Tavazoie's lab uses xenograft, patient-derived
   xenograft, immunocompetent and genetically initiated models.

   Dr. Tavazoie's overarching goals are to systematically identify the
   gene networks that operate downstream of these small RNA regulators, to
   determine how the activities of these small RNAs are modulated during
   the acquisition of metastatic capacity, to uncover the cell-biological
   and cellular roles of these microRNA regulatory pathways in cancer, to
   determine the physiological or developmental roles of these regulators
   and their key target genes, and to identify and therapeutically target
   key vulnerabilities within these networks in cancer. The insights
   gained from these studies could reveal previously uncharacterized
   mechanisms of gene expression regulation that might operate in normal
   cells and could reveal new avenues for therapeutic intervention in
   patients at risk for metastatic relapse.

CAREER

   Dr. Tavazoie received his undergraduate degree from the University of
   California, Berkeley, his Ph.D. from Harvard University and his M.D.
   from Harvard Medical School and the Harvard-MIT Division of Health
   Sciences and Technology. Following a residency and internship in
   internal medicine at Harvard's Brigham and Women's Hospital, he joined
   Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center as a clinical fellow in 2005 and
   became a research fellow in medical oncology in 2006. He joined
   Rockefeller as an assistant professor in 2009 and was named associate
   professor in 2015.

   In 2009 Dr. Tavazoie was the recipient of the NIH Director's New
   Innovator Award and a combined American Society of Clinical Oncology
   and American Association for Cancer Research Young Investigator Award.
   He was also named a Rita Allen Foundation Scholar, a Sidney Kimmel
   Foundation for Cancer Research Scholar and a Sinsheimer Foundation
   Scholar, and he received an Emerald Foundation Young Investigator
   Award. He is also a Department of Defense Era of Hope Scholar. Dr.
   Tavazoie is an attending medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering
   Cancer Center.

   Dr. Tavazoie is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
