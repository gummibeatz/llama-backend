Faculty Bio

   Robert Darnell

   Dr. Darnell's laboratory focuses on understanding a group of rare brain
   diseases, the paraneoplastic neurologic disorders, and how they arise
   in conjunction with immune responses to cancer. Through his work
   identifying the target proteins involved in the disorders, Dr. Darnell
   has also become interested in the role of RNA-binding proteins in the
   brain and in disease.

   The Darnell lab studies paraneoplastic neurologic disorders (PNDs), a
   group of diseases thought to arise when tumors -- typically breast,
   ovarian or lung cancers -- start making proteins that are normally only
   made by the brain. Patients with PNDs carry antibodies that
   specifically target these proteins, but while this situation produces
   an effective antitumor immune response, it also leads to an autoimmune
   attack on brain tissue.

   Using a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches, Dr.
   Darnell's lab is asking basic questions about how these antitumor and
   autoimmune responses develop. The lab has shown that the immune systems
   of PND patients thwart tumors with what begins as a classical antiviral
   response: The patients' T cells produce CD8+ killer T cells that
   recognize the neuronal antigens found within their tumors. In some
   patients there are atypical, less potent T cells present, perhaps
   evidence of tumor cells' efforts to evade tumor immunity. The lab also
   discovered that apoptotic tumor cells serve as potent instigators of
   the T cell immune response in PND patients and has worked on developing
   cancer vaccines in small-scale clinical trials at The Rockefeller
   University Hospital to mimic PND tumor immunity.

   This work merges with studies on what the PND antigens are: What is
   their normal role in neurons, and why do tumors induce their
   expression? These questions led Dr. Darnell's lab to discover and
   explore the function of neuron-specific RNA-binding proteins in the
   mammalian brain. Studies have focused on proteins involved in RNA
   regulation in the PND antigens Hu (nElavl) and Nova, the related
   protein FMRP (the protein mutated in fragile X mental retardation),
   Argonaute (the RNA-binding protein that works together with microRNAs
   to regulate messenger RNA translation and stability) and others,
   including Ptbp2, Mbln2 and Rbfox. The function of these proteins has
   been studied using a general and powerful method the lab developed
   called high throughput sequencing-cross-linking immunoprecipitation, or
   HITS-CLIP, to create genome-wide maps of where RNA-binding proteins
   bind to RNA in living tissue. HITS-CLIP, together with analysis of
   knockout mice and bioinformatic approaches, led to the discovery that
   the position of protein binding in the messenger RNA is a prime
   determinant of the outcome of alternative splicing or polyadenylation,
   general rules applicable to many splicing factors. Recent computational
   improvements in analyses of HITS-CLIP maps have allowed robust
   genome-wide predictions of combinatorial RNA regulation and
   single-nucleotide resolution of protein interaction sites in the brain.
   The lab has also developed functional insight into RNA dysregulation in
   disease, including that mediated by FMRP, and revealed its mechanism of
   action and connection with autism spectrum disorders. Studies with Nova
   have led to insight into the balance of neuronal inhibition and
   excitation and into control of spinal motor neuron function, leading to
   new approaches to the study of Lou Gehrig's disease.

   These interests have begun to focus on the power of modern high
   throughput genomics to understand the role of RNA regulation in human
   disease and, in turn, led to Dr. Darnell's involvement in the New York
   Genome Center.

CAREER

   Dr. Darnell received his undergraduate degrees in biology and chemistry
   from Columbia University in 1979 and earned his M.D. and Ph.D. in 1985
   from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, where he
   specialized in molecular biology. Dr. Darnell trained in internal
   medicine at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and in neurology at Weill
   Cornell Medical College with Fred Plum and Jerome Posner, where he was
   chief neurology resident. Dr. Darnell joined The Rockefeller University
   in 1992 as assistant professor and associate physician at The
   Rockefeller University Hospital. He was named associate professor in
   1997 and professor and senior physician in 2000. In 2002 Dr. Darnell
   was appointed investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and
   named Heilbrunn Professor at Rockefeller. He is also attending
   neurologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, associate
   professor at Weill Cornell and president of the New York Genome Center.

   Dr. Darnell's awards include the Burroughs Wellcome Fund Clinical
   Scientist Award in Translational Research in 2000, the Derek
   Denny-Brown Young Neurological Scholar Award in 1998 and the Irma T.
   Hirschl Trust Career Scientist Award in 1996. In 2012 he became
   President and Scientific Director of the New York Genome Center.  He is
   a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine
   and the Association of American Physicians and is a fellow of the
   American Association for the Advancement of Science.

   Dr. Darnell is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
