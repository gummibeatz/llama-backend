   Charles Gilbert

   Dr. Gilbert studies the mechanisms underlying visual perception,
   including the specific role of the brain's primary visual cortex in
   analyzing visual images and in perceptual learning. To this end, his
   laboratory investigates the circuitry of the brain and how the
   interactions between groups of neurons contribute to perception,
   learning and memory.

   The Gilbert laboratory studies the primary visual cortex, a credit
   card-sized region of cells at the back of the brain and the site of the
   initial stage of cortical processing of information. The job of the
   visual cortex is to take signals coming from the retina, group features
   of visual scenes belonging to objects, and determine their shapes. The
   laboratory investigates the mechanism, at the level of cortical
   circuitry, by which this occurs. They discovered a plexus of long-range
   horizontal connections that mediate the assembly of contours and the
   parsing of visual scenes into objects and background. Using a
   combination of single-cell electrophysiological recordings, optical
   imaging of cortical functional architecture and multiphoton imaging of
   labeled cortical connections, Dr. Gilbert has found close
   correspondence between the geometry of these connections, the
   functional properties of visual cortical neurons and the perception of
   visual stimuli.

   The laboratory also studies the way visual experience shapes the
   strategy by which the cortex analyzes sensory information, a process
   known as perceptual learning. They are interested in the contributions
   of different cortical areas along the visual pathway that facilitate
   this learning and are characterizing the functional changes at the
   level of individual neurons. The Gilbert laboratory has found that,
   even in adults, the visual cortex is capable of altering its functional
   properties and circuitry as a response to experiencing visual stimuli.
   These long-term changes aid in analyzing visual scenes as a result of
   normal visual experience and play a role in functional recovery after
   damage of the central nervous system. The role of experience in
   altering cortical circuits is seen in the remapping of cortical
   functional architecture following retinal lesions. This procedure
   initially silences parts of the visual cortex, but over a period of
   weeks the cortex regains its ability to respond to visual stimuli. They
   found that the long-term changes involve axonal sprouting and
   synaptogenesis. The lab is studying the molecular mechanisms underlying
   experience-dependent changes in cortical circuits. Understanding
   adaptive changes in cortical function at the level of functional
   architecture, circuitry and gene expression provides important insights
   into the mechanism of recovery after brain lesions and
   neurodegenerative disease, including macular degeneration.

   The Gilbert lab has shown that the properties of the visual cortex
   reflect both sensory and behavioral contexts, suggesting that each
   cortical area is an adaptive processor that runs different programs
   according to the immediate demands of the perceptual task. Object
   recognition, for example, involves a countercurrent process of
   feedforward and feedback interactions. The top-down signal conveys
   information about attentional locus, perceptual task and object
   expectation. These results led to a novel view of cortical processing:
   Rather than having fixed functional properties, adult neurons are
   dynamically tuned, changing their specificities with varying sensory
   experience and behavioral context. Understanding the role of top-down
   interactions in sensory processing is likely to provide insight into
   behavioral disorders such as schizophrenia and autism, which have been
   suggested to be "disconnection syndromes," or a dysfunction of top-down
   interactions between areas of the cerebral cortex. Based on these
   findings, Dr. Gilbert's lab uses computational models to link cortical
   circuits and the properties of neuronal ensembles to visual perception.

   Dr. Gilbert and his colleagues use electrophysiology, imaging and
   molecular approaches to understand the mechanisms of adult cortical
   plasticity. Combining virally mediated gene transfer with two-photon
   imaging, they have been able to study the contribution of different
   neuronal types and circuit components to experience dependence changes
   in cortical function. They study the circuitry and synaptic mechanisms
   underlying the dynamic changes in functional properties of cortical
   cells in behaving animals. They use electrophysiological recordings to
   study the more complex properties of cortical cells and their
   dependence on top-down influences and perceptual learning. Finally,
   they use human psychophysics to explore the perceptual consequences of
   dynamic changes in cortical properties.

CAREER

   Dr. Gilbert received his M.D. and Ph.D. from Harvard Medical School in
   1977, where he held an academic appointment until he joined Rockefeller
   in 1983 as assistant professor and head of laboratory. He became
   associate professor in 1985 and professor in 1991 and in 2004 was named
   Arthur and Janet Ross Professor.

   A member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy
   of Arts and Sciences, he has received numerous awards, including the W.
   Alden Spencer Award from the Columbia University College of Physicians
   and Surgeons.

   Dr. Gilbert is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
