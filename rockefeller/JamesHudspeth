Faculty Bio

   A. Hudspeth

   The majority of the hearing impaired suffer from sensorineural hearing
   loss, also referred to as "nerve deafness." Despite its name, this type
   of hearing loss usually results from damage to the hair cells of the
   inner ear. The human cochlea contains about 16,000 of these hair cells,
   which do not regenerate once they have been damaged. Dr. Hudspeth's
   laboratory is working to better understand the normal hearing process
   and causes of hearing deterioration as an initial step toward the
   prevention or reversal of deafness.

   Sound consists of rapid pressure fluctuations in the air, and hearing
   commences when these signals impinge upon the external ear, setting the
   eardrum into oscillatory motion. This movement is relayed through the
   three miniscule bones of the middle ear -- the hammer, anvil and
   stirrup -- to the snail-shaped cochlea. Within the cochlea, these
   mechanical signals are converted into vibrations along the basilar
   membrane, upon which the hair cells stand in four ranks. Each hair cell
   is endowed with a few hundred fine "feelers," or stereocilia, that
   collectively constitute its hair bundle. Sound-induced vibrations set
   the hair bundles in motion, evoking electrical responses by opening and
   closing mechanically sensitive ion channels in the stimulated bundles.
   As a result of the direct mechanical connection between the hair bundle
   and ion channels, the transduction process of hair cells is remarkably
   rapid; we can consequently hear sounds at frequencies as great as 20
   kHz. The direct nature of auditory transduction also makes the process
   highly sensitive.

   The extraordinary sensitivity of our hearing suggests that the cochlea
   amplifies its mechanical inputs, and researchers in Dr. Hudspeth's lab
   are exploring how human hearing benefits from a tiny mechanical
   amplifier in each hair bundle. They have found that bundles are
   spontaneously active, oscillating through a distance of ±30 nm. This
   unprovoked activity likely underlies the spontaneous emission of sound
   measured from many normal ears, including those of 70 percent of
   humans. When a small stimulus force is applied to an active bundle, the
   bundle's motion becomes synchronized with the stimulus. Measurement of
   the mechanical work performed in this situation confirms that a hair
   bundle can amplify and tune its mechanical inputs. Members of the
   research group are now extending these results to the mammalian ear.
   Using a theoretical approach to model the mammalian ear, they are also
   exploring the mechanism by which low-frequency sounds are amplified.
   Identifying the active process in the human cochlea is especially
   important because hearing loss usually begins with deterioration of
   this amplifier.

   In an effort to learn how hair cells develop, Dr. Hudspeth's group is
   conducting molecular-biological experiments on the larval zebra-fish.
   In the lateral line of this species, new hair cells arise continually
   to replace those that die as a result of aging or chemical toxicity.
   The division of a precursor cell consistently produces a pair of hair
   cells of opposite polarity, one of which responds to water movement
   toward the animal's anterior, the other sensitive to posterior flow. In
   the hope of establishing what signaling pathways lead to the production
   of new hair cells, members of the group are isolating both hair cells
   and their precursors and examining their gene expression. The
   investigators hope to identify pathways that might be activated in the
   human ear to foster hair cell replacement. Other experimenters are
   studying how individual nerve fibers distinguish between hair cells of
   the two polarities, selectively innervating only one of the two sets.

   Dr. Hudspeth's research has led to a deepened understanding of the
   intricacies of the inner ear and how they contribute to hearing and
   hearing loss. He hopes that further investigation will indicate both
   the causes of and potential remedies for certain forms of human hearing
   impairment, an affliction that affects 10 percent of the American
   population.

CAREER

   Dr. Hudspeth received his bachelor's degree in biochemistry from
   Harvard University in 1967 and his M.D. in 1973 and Ph.D. in 1974 from
   the same institution. After a postdoctoral fellowship at the Karolinska
   Institute in Stockholm, he accepted a faculty position at the
   California Institute of Technology. He relocated to the University of
   California, San Francisco, in 1983, and in 1989 he moved to The
   University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, where he
   founded the school's neuroscience program. Dr. Hudspeth came to
   Rockefeller in 1995 and was named the F.M. Kirby Professor. He is also
   director of the F.M. Kirby Center for Sensory Neuroscience.

   Dr. Hudspeth received the Charles A. Dana Award for Pioneering
   Achievements in Health and the W. Alden Spencer Award from the Columbia
   University College of Physicians and Surgeons. He is also a recipient
   of the Ralph W. Gerard Prize from the Society for Neuroscience, the
   K.S. Cole Award in membrane biophysics from the Biophysical Society,
   the Award of Merit from the Association for Research in Otolaryngology,
   and the Guyot Prize from the University of Groningen. Dr. Hudspeth is a
   member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of
   Arts and Sciences and is an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical
   Institute.

   Dr. Hudspeth is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
