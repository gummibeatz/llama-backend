Faculty Bio

   Jue Chen

   Cells use certain membrane proteins to pump molecules in or out against
   a concentration gradient. Dr. Chen studies a class of these proteins
   known as ATP-binding cassette, or ABC, transporters that power
   themselves using ATP. She is investigating ABC transporters' role in
   normal cellular processes and in disease, including drug resistance.

   Scientists have identified about 2,000 total ABC transporters found in
   all types of cells; 48 of these occur in human cells. These transporter
   proteins play a role in many important cellular processes, pumping an
   array of molecules, from nutrients to toxins and cellular building
   material, through the membrane bilayer. Because this molecular cargo is
   moving from low to high concentration, the transporter protein consumes
   energy.

   The maltose transporter protein, a type of ABC transporter, brings a
   sugar known as maltose into a bacterial cell to support growth. Using
   x-ray crystallography, Dr. Chen and colleagues have devised a way to
   visualize how this transporter converts the chemical energy of ATP
   hydrolysis into mechanical work through a series of conformational
   changes.

   Dr. Chen's interests have now shifted to ABC transporters involved in
   the immune system and disease. For example, her lab now focuses on an
   ABC transporter known as P-glycoprotein. Discovered in the 1970s,
   P-glycoprotein plays a Jekyll-and-Hyde role in human health. This
   transporter recognizes an array of structurally related compounds and
   pumps them out of the cell. When the cell in question is cancerous and
   the compounds are therapies targeting some aspect of the cell's
   internal machinery, P-glycoprotein's action reduces the effectiveness
   of chemotherapy.

   But, by doing essentially the same thing, P-glycoprotein also helps
   maintain the integrity of the blood-brain barrier by keeping certain
   types of molecules from entering the central nervous system. This
   function can create problems for drugs that need to get into the
   central nervous system.

   In the long term, Dr. Chen hopes to combine structural and functional
   work to reveal the molecular mechanism of multidrug transporters and to
   develop novel reagents for chemotherapy.

CAREER

   Dr. Chen received her bachelor's of science in chemistry from Ohio
   University and her Ph.D. in biochemistry from Harvard University, where
   she was advised by Don C. Wiley. She did postdoctoral work at Baylor
   College of Medicine with Florante A. Quiocho. She joined Purdue
   University in 2002 as assistant professor of biology and was promoted
   to associate professor in 2007 and professor in 2011. She was named a
   Pew Scholar in 2003 and was named an investigator of the Howard Hughes
   Medical Institute in 2008. She joined Rockefeller's faculty in 2014.

   Dr. Chen is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
