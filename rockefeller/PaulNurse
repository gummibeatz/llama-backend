Faculty Bio

   Paul Nurse

   Dr Nurse's research focuses on the molecular machineries that control
   cell division and cell shape. Using the fission yeast
   Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a model system, his laboratory studies the
   cell cycle and cell morphogenesis controls operative in eukaryotic
   cells. His major past contribution was the codiscovery of
   cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) as the key regulator molecule controlling
   S phase and mitosis, findings that have had implications for
   understanding cell reproduction, cell growth, development and cancer.

   Present work in the Nurse laboratory is in three areas: the cell cycle,
   cell form and genomic studies. The lab is split on two sites, with the
   major activity located at the Francis Crick Institute in London, and a
   smaller group located at The Rockefeller University, which works mainly
   on combining chemical biology and genetics to investigate cell biology
   problems in fission yeast. This work is in collaboration with two
   Rockefeller University faculty members, Tarun Kapoor and Howard C.
   Hang.

   With Dr. Kapoor, the Nurse lab works on the development and use of
   fission yeast for chemical biology. A fission yeast strain has been
   constructed with compromised multidrug resistance, allowing chemical
   drug screens and experiments to be carried out efficiently. This strain
   has been used in synthetic lethal approaches to identify chemicals that
   influence the course of mitosis. Two chemical drugs and their targets
   have been identified and characterized. The first inhibits fatty acid
   synthase, which reduces nuclear membrane growth during telophase, and
   the second inhibits Aurora protein kinase and has been used to
   demonstrate that the various functions of this kinase are triggered by
   different levels of activity.

   With Dr. Hang, the Nurse lab has identified protein palmitolyation as
   an important determinant for meiotic commitment.

   Another project is the characterization of the spatial and temporal
   organization of origin usage during S phase. This has shown that
   origins are initially fired stochastically along the chromosomes and
   then become grouped in clusters. The positions of these clusters vary
   in different S phases, and the clusters appear to correspond to foci of
   replication observed in eukaryotic S phase nuclei. A further project is
   using bioinformatic approaches to link cell cycle and cell form genes
   to human cancer, particularly breast cancer.

CAREER

   Dr. Nurse, a native of the United Kingdom, graduated from Birmingham
   University in 1970 and received his Ph.D. in cell biology and
   biochemistry from the University of East Anglia in 1973. He did
   postdoctoral work at universities in Bern, Switzerland, Edinburgh and
   Sussex and joined the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF) in London in
   1984. In 1988 he moved to the University of Oxford as chair of its
   department of microbiology, and he returned to ICRF in 1993 as a
   director of research. He became director general in 1996 and in 2002
   was appointed chief executive of Cancer Research UK, formed when he
   merged ICRF with the Cancer Research Campaign. He was president of The
   Rockefeller University from 2003 to 2011, when he became director of
   the Francis Crick Institute in London.

   Dr. Nurse is a fellow of The Royal Society of the UK and a foreign
   associate of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. He received The
   Royal Society's Royal and Copley medals and the Legion d'Honneur in
   2002, the Lasker Award in 1998 and the Nobel Prize in Physiology or
   Medicine in 2001. In 1999 he was honored with knighthood in Great
   Britain for services in cancer research and cell biology and since 2000
   has been a member of the UK Council for Science and Technology advising
   the prime minister. He is presently the 60th president of The Royal
   Society.

   Dr. Nurse is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
