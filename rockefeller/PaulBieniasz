Faculty Bio

   Paul Bieniasz

   The biology and evolution of retroviruses and eukaryotes are closely
   linked. Dr. Bieniasz seeks to define how host gene products influence
   the replication of retroviruses, with an emphasis on human and primate
   immunodeficiency viruses. There are two dominant research areas in his
   lab: characterizing the host-cell factors and pathways that are
   mimicked, manipulated and otherwise exploited by retroviruses, and
   studying host functions that have evolved specifically to defend cells
   against retrovirus infection.

   One major focus of Dr. Bieniasz's lab is determining how retrovirus
   structural proteins are transported, assembled and released from cells
   as infectious particles. The role of host factors and pathways in these
   processes has been one of the most enigmatic areas in retrovirology,
   but one that is gradually becoming clearer. For example, Dr. Bieniasz
   has shown that many enveloped viruses -- retroviruses included --
   specifically recruit components of a cellular pathway that normally
   mediates the budding of vesicles into the lumen of endosomes. Dr.
   Bieniasz found that viral proteins redirect vesicle budding and
   ubiquitin ligation machinery to sites of virus assembly in order to
   facilitate the formation of an enveloped virus particle. Other related
   problems that the lab is investigating include defining how retroviral
   proteins select the locations within the cell at which they're
   assembled; in particular, how they are affected by the cellular
   environment and host molecules as well as the intrinsic membrane
   binding and multimerizing properties of retroviral Gag proteins.

   A second major area of interest is "intrinsic immunity." Evolution has
   equipped mammals with several gene products specifically to prevent or
   attenuate retrovirus replication. Intrinsic immunity differs from
   classical innate immunity in that it doesn't seem to require any form
   of signaling or intercellular communication to be activated. Rather, it
   apparently consists of constitutively expressed intracellular proteins
   that exhibit potent antiretroviral activity. Dr. Bieniasz works on
   three classes of inhibitors. One class (exemplified by Fv1 and TRIM5)
   blocks infection by targeting incoming retrovirus capsids. Prior
   research by Dr. Bieniasz has shown that this class of inhibitors
   prevents HIV-1 infection in cells from some nonhuman primates. The
   human version of this inhibitor protects against some retroviruses, but
   not HIV. A second class is comprised of cytidine deaminases (such as
   APOBEC3G) that induce lethal hypermutation of retroviral genomes.

   Recently, research from the Bieniasz lab has identified a third type of
   antiviral molecule, called tetherin, that prevents virus particles from
   being released from the cell surface and moving off to infect other
   cells. Dr. Bieniasz has also found that HIV uses another protein,
   called Vpu, to counteract tetherin and allow budding virus particles to
   depart from the cell surface.

   Understanding how these cellular antiretroviral activities work and how
   some retroviruses, particularly primate immunodeficiency viruses, have
   acquired new functions that confer resistance to them could provide new
   opportunities to develop novel therapies and improved animal models of
   AIDS. To that end, the Bieniasz lab recently developed a strain of
   HIV-1 that can infect pig-tailed macaques. The virus differs from that
   found in humans by a single gene that protects it from the monkey's
   APOBEC3 inhibitors. With further work, the new strain, dubbed simian
   tropic HIV-1, could provide a reliable animal model for testing HIV
   vaccines and other treatments.

CAREER

   Dr. Bieniasz received his undergraduate degree in biochemistry from the
   University of Bath in 1990 and his Ph.D. in virology from Imperial
   College, University of London, in 1996. He was a postdoc at Duke
   University until 1999, studying molecular retrovirology, and then
   accepted positions as a staff investigator at the Aaron Diamond AIDS
   Research Center (ADARC) and as an assistant professor at Rockefeller.
   In 2003 he was named by ADARC an Aaron Diamond Associate Professor at
   The Rockefeller University and in 2004 was promoted by Rockefeller to
   associate professor, head of laboratory.

   Dr. Bieniasz was a 2003 recipient of the Elizabeth Glaser Scientist
   Award from the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation and the 2010
   recipient of the Eli Lilly and Company Research Award. He is also an
   investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

   Dr. Bienasz is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
