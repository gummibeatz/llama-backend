   Charles Rice

   Globally, an estimated 130 million people are infected with hepatitis C
   virus (HCV), a major cause of acute hepatitis and chronic liver
   disease, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. There is currently no
   HCV vaccine, and although new antiviral drugs were recently approved
   and are clinically available, more will be needed to combat resistance
   and target all genotypes. Dr. Rice's lab focuses on understanding virus
   replication, host responses to infection and developing new therapies
   to treat HCV and other viral pathogens.

   The Rice lab seeks new ways of blocking HCV infection by studying how
   the virus replicates. Traditionally, blocking the actions of essential
   viral enzymes has been key to generating effective antiviral drugs.
   With collaborators at the University of Missouri, the lab has been
   studying drug combinations and the mechanisms of drug resistance.  Dr.
   Rice's group has also analyzed the biochemistry and structure of a
   number of HCV proteins, such as the viral helicase, the nonstructural
   protein NS5A, and the NS2-3 autoprotease. Since all are necessary for
   virus replication, understanding how they work may help in the design
   of new inhibitors that target these proteins.

   Another of Dr. Rice's research interests is the development and
   improvement of systems to propagate viruses in vitro and in vivo.  For
   example, growing HCV in cell culture has been difficult and restricted
   to only a few select genotypes and isolates.  Recently, the Rice group
   found that overexpressing selected host cell proteins allows growth of
   a broader number of HCV isolates, and studies of the mechanism by which
   these proteins promote replication are underway.  A collaborative
   effort with colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has
   resulted in improved methods to infect otherwise healthy human
   hepatocytes in culture. Unlike previous culture models, which depend on
   cancerous cells, HCV infection of normal liver cells may more
   accurately reflect what happens in a patient and yield clues about how
   the virus causes disease.  More recently, this work has been extended
   to studies of the viral life cycle in stem cell-derived hepatocytes,
   which is paving the way toward personalized medicine applications.
   Alongside improving culture systems, Dr. Rice's group has pioneered new
   methods to concentrate HCV, enabling analysis of its structure and
   composition with electron microscopy, which in turn, will inform the
   design of vaccines and new drugs targeting virus particles.
   Additionally, the Rice lab has been developing an HCV-permissive
   transgenic mouse model, and also animals engrafted with human liver and
   immune tissues susceptible to HCV infection and capable of mounting
   human virus-specific immune responses.

   The Rice lab is also interested in developing bioinformatic approaches
   to study host-virus interactions at a systems level.  Using novel
   techniques such as HITS-CLIP and RNAseq, the Rice lab is analyzing the
   role of cellular micro RNAs and RNA-binding proteins in regulating the
   replication of HCV and other RNA viruses.  Laser-capture
   microdissection of infected, uninfected, and bystander cells has
   allowed specific comparisons of the cellular responses at a genetic
   level.  Because these experiments can be applied in a variety of
   settings, such as different viruses, chronic vs. acute infection,
   different genotypes or cell types, they will help to illuminate the
   complex relationship between host and pathogen in a panoramic and
   genome-wide view.

   The strategies that viruses use to escape from host defenses are of
   significant interest, as failure of the immune response can result in
   chronic disease. Even as viruses evade adaptive immunity, innate
   antiviral mechanisms may limit their replication and spread. Exploiting
   innate cellular factors that limit viral entry and replication is an
   additional strategy for developing antiviral therapeutics. The Rice lab
   recently reported a comprehensive screen for antiviral activities of
   naturally occurring cellular defense proteins, termed
   interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Interestingly, unique combinations
   of these genes, or "ISG profiles," were found to target different
   viruses. Understanding the mechanisms of ISG inhibition is a
   prerequisite to potential exploitation of these processes to interfere
   with virus growth, and mechanistic studies are underway. The
   zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) is an ISG that potently inhibits
   the replication of members of the Alphavirus genus. Using the prototype
   alphavirus, Sindbis virus, as a model system, investigators led by
   Research Associate Professor Margaret R. MacDonald are working to
   understand ZAP's mechanism and how it functions in concert with other
   ISGs. Dr. MacDonald is also investigating the role of cellular
   chaperone proteins in flavivirus RNA replication.

   Together, all these investigations interrogate both sides of the
   virus-host cell relationship, with the overarching objective of
   designing efficacious new therapies and vaccines.  Additional studies
   underway on viral pathogens related to HCV, such as dengue virus,
   yellow fever virus, and influenza A virus will shed light on the
   specificities of their interactions with host cells.  They will also be
   broadly instructive toward novel strategies to tip the balance in the
   age-old warfare between pathogenic viruses and their hosts.

CAREER

   Dr. Rice received his Ph.D. in biochemistry in 1981 from the California
   Institute of Technology, where he was then a postdoctoral research
   fellow from 1981 to 1985. Before he joined Rockefeller in 2000, he
   spent 14 years on the faculty of the Washington University School of
   Medicine. Dr. Rice is scientific and executive director of the Center
   for the Study of Hepatitis C, an interdisciplinary center established
   jointly by The Rockefeller University, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital
   and Weill Cornell Medical College. Dr. Rice is a member of the National
   Academy of Sciences.

   Dr. Rice is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
