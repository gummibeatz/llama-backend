Faculty Bio

   Konstantin Goulianos

   In an attempt to understand the creation, evolution and eventual fate
   of the universe, Dr. Goulianos and his colleagues study the basic
   constituents of matter and their interactions, watching as particles
   are accelerated to very high energies and brought into head-on
   collisions. Their research is concentrated at the Fermilab Tevatron
   Collider in Illinois and at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in
   Switzerland.

   A large fraction of the energy in particle collisions is converted into
   particles flying away from the collision point in a fashion reminiscent
   of exploding fireworks. Most of the created particles have an ephemeral
   existence, decaying after a brief period of time into more stable ones.
   Detailed studies of the properties of all known particles have revealed
   an inner order, which has been coded into a theoretical framework known
   as the Standard Model. Matter in all its forms, from stars to living
   organisms, can be described in terms of 12 fundamental particles, six
   quarks and six leptons, interacting among themselves by exchanging
   force particles -- gluons, photons or W and Z bosons -- following
   strict mathematical rules based on symmetry principles.

   Founded in 1970, Dr. Goulianos's laboratory has made substantial
   contributions to establishing the Standard Model as the premier theory
   of particle physics. Their experiments at the Intersecting Storage
   Rings at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, provided
   early evidence for the existence of quarks through the measurement of
   high transverse momentum particle production. In experiments at the
   Brookhaven National Laboratory, they discovered and measured the rate
   of neutrino-proton elastic scattering, confirming the neutral-current
   interactions predicted by the Standard Model. And using the Fermilab
   Tevatron, the Goulianos laboratory contributed to the discovery of the
   top quark. Despite its phenomenal predictive power, the Standard Model
   is far from the "theory of everything." It does not incorporate gravity
   and has no obvious explanation for dark matter or dark energy, of which
   most of the universe is made. The ultimate theory, the "DNA of nature,"
   is still at large.

   Using data collected by the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) at the
   proton-antiproton Tevatron collider, Dr. Goulianos and his colleagues
   have been performing searches for the Higgs particle, the quantum of
   the field that could explain the diversity of quark masses; for
   supersymmetry and extra dimensions, theoretical ideas aimed at
   accommodating gravity and explaining dark matter and dark energy; and
   studying diffractive phenomena. The latter provide a window to
   nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics, a component of the Standard
   Model important for understanding the structure of strongly interacting
   particles like the proton. The data for these searches have been
   collected with the CDF II detector, in which the Goulianos laboratory
   has made seminal contributions to several crucial detector components,
   including the plug calorimeter, the shower-maximum detector and the
   scintillator-tile pre-shower detector. So far, over 600 papers have
   been published by the CDF collaboration in refereed journals. Tevatron
   collider operations ceased in September 2011, but data analysis is
   still continuing.

   The Goulianos laboratory also participates in the international
   collaboration of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the
   Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The LHC was completed and
   commissioned in the fall of 2009 as the world's largest particle
   accelerator. More than 330 papers have been published by CMS
   collaborators in refereed journals. The accelerator has reached an
   energy level four times higher than the Tevatron, which increased the
   discovery potential for new physics within and beyond the Standard
   Model. Team members have been working on measuring the energies of jets
   (the streams of particles that are emitted when quarks or gluons
   interact) and developing statistical techniques. Measuring the
   directions and energies of the particles in a jet allows scientists to,
   for instance, differentiate the Higgs's mass from its decay products,
   while statistical techniques help optimize the data analysis. On July
   4, 2012, the CMS and ATLAS experiments announced the discovery of a new
   particle of mass around 125 billion electron volts with properties
   consistent with those expected for the Higgs. Further studies have now
   positively identified this particle as a Higgs boson, bringing to a
   conclusion a half-century endeavor and providing a new pedestal from
   which to launch searches for the roots of the remaining mysteries of
   the universe.

   Carrying the experience gained at the Tevatron to the LHC, Dr.
   Goulianos and his team are working to further characterize the Higgs
   boson and make new discoveries in the areas of diffraction and beyond
   the Standard Model physics.

CAREER

   Dr. Goulianos was born in Thessaloniki, Greece, and studied chemistry
   at the University of Thessaloniki, where he completed his undergraduate
   course requirements in 1958. Later that year he came to the United
   States as a Fulbright Scholar and earned his Ph.D. in physics from
   Columbia University in 1963. He continued at Columbia as a research
   associate until 1964, when he joined Princeton University as an
   instructor and was promoted to assistant professor in 1967. Dr.
   Goulianos joined Rockefeller as associate professor in 1971 and was
   named professor in 1981. He is a fellow of the American Physical
   Society.

   Dr. Goulianos is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
