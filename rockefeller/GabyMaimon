Faculty Bio

   Gaby Maimon

   The Maimon lab aims to link the electrical activity of neurons and the
   biochemical action of molecules to their computational roles in animal
   behavior. The lab has a particular interest in understanding how
   central brain structures, distant from the sensory and motor periphery,
   govern behavioral choice.

   Whereas much is known about sensory and motor processing in
   the nervous system, it remains less clear how brains perform higher,
   integrative functions such as deciding to initiate a movement, changing
   course once a movement has begun, incorporating past experiences into
   ongoing behavioral choices, flexibly coupling sensory inputs to correct
   motor outputs and ignoring irrelevant sensory stimuli so as to focus on
   relevant stimuli. The Maimon
   lab studies integrative processes such as these in the fruit fly,
   Drosophila melanogaster.

   Fruit flies are an established system for genetics, with over 100 years
   of seminal findings. Flies have also served an important role in
   ethology, the study of natural animal behavior, and comparative studies
   across Drosophila have shed light on how innate behaviors evolve. The
   Maimon lab combines these classical approaches with modern
   electrophysiological methods to gain new insights into higher brain
   function.

   Because flies are small, it has not been possible, traditionally, to
   record neuronal activity as they behave. Dr. Maimon recently developed
   a platform for behavioral neurophysiology in Drosophila. The primary
   approach taken by the lab is to use this new methodology to record the
   electrical activity of genetically identified neurons in actively
   behaving flies. In these experiments, flies typically perform tethered
   flight or walking behaviors in response to sensory stimuli, such as
   visual images presented on a panoramic display. The Maimon lab uses the
   sensitive patch-clamp technique to measure small changes in membrane
   voltage or current in single neurons. They combine this technique with
   imaging approaches to visualize physiological activity in larger groups
   of cells. The behavioral-physiological experiments typically lead to
   studies at the molecular-genetic level, to flesh out mechanism, and
   quantitative investigations of free behavior, to inform function.

   As a first use of the behavioral-physiology platform, Dr. Maimon
   obtained recordings from a well-studied class of visual neurons in the
   fly brain, the vertical system (VS) cells. These neurons process visual
   motion and are thought to help flies stabilize their flight; however,
   no one had recorded from VS cells while flies were actually flying. Dr.
   Maimon demonstrated that VS cells double their response strength during
   flight, suggesting that the brain can dynamically increase the gain of
   visual signals when necessary. This change in gain may act like a gate;
   VS cells may drive downstream neurons effectively during locomotion,
   when response gain is high, but ineffectively during behavioral
   quiescence, when response gain is low. Similar gain changes have been
   observed in other species, including vertebrates, and thus studying
   Drosophila may give insight into how and why brains dynamically change
   the strength of sensory signals.

   Current work is focused on central, integrative structures deeper
   within the fly nervous system and on developing behavioral paradigms to
   probe how flies compute and store the value of behaviorally relevant
   variables. The work provides a platform for discovering basic
   mechanisms of how brains integrate, think and decide.

CAREER

   Dr. Maimon received his undergraduate degree from Cornell University
   and his Ph.D. in neuroscience from Harvard University in 2005, working
   in the laboratory of John Assad. He conducted his postdoctoral training
   from 2005 to 2010 at the California Institute of Technology with
   Michael Dickinson. He joined The Rockefeller University as assistant
   professor in 2011.

   Dr. Maimon's honors include the 2012 Presidential Early Career Award
   for Science and Engineering, the 2012 NIH Director's New Innovator
   Award, the Searle Scholar Award, the Alfred P. Sloan Research
   Fellowship, the New York Stem Cell Foundation's Robertson Neuroscience
   Investigator Award and the Irma T. Hirschl/Monique Weill-Caulier Trusts
   Research Award. He was named one of Popular Science's Brilliant Ten in
   2011.

   Dr. Maimon is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
