Faculty Bio

   Barry Coller

   When blood vessels break, platelets stop the bleeding by adhering to
   the damaged vessel walls. They then aggregate with each other and
   facilitate thrombin production and fibrin deposition, both of which are
   key components of blood coagulation. Dr. Coller's research focuses on
   molecular interactions between blood cells and blood vessels as they
   relate to platelet physiology, thrombosis, vascular biology and
   adhesion phenomena, with the ultimate goal of developing new therapies
   for thrombotic diseases such as heart attack and stroke.

   Because platelets play a vital role in blood coagulation, deficiencies
   in their numbers or function can result in excessive bleeding. But when
   platelets adhere to and aggregate on blood vessels narrowed by
   atherosclerosis, they can close off the blood vessel and cause a
   myocardial infarction (heart attack) or stroke.

   By studying the receptors responsible for platelet aggregation and
   patients who genetically lack the receptors, Dr. Coller established the
   platelet aIIbb3 (GPIIb/IIIa) receptor as an important target for
   antithrombotic therapy. This led him to develop monoclonal antibodies
   to the aIIbb3 receptor that inhibit platelet aggregation. Working with
   scientists at Centocor, Dr. Coller helped develop a derivative of one
   of these antibodies into the drug abciximab, which was approved in 1994
   to prevent ischemic complications of percutaneous coronary
   interventions, such as stent placement in patients with myocardial
   infarction and related conditions. More than four million patients
   worldwide have been treated with abciximab.

   Current research in Dr. Coller's lab focuses on multiple areas of
   platelet physiology. One of those areas is the genetic disorder
   Glanzmann thrombasthenia, which produces hemorrhage as a result of an
   abnormality of the aIIbb3 receptor. Dr. Coller and his lab members are
   studying the precise genetic and protein abnormalities responsible for
   the disease.

   Other areas of blood and platelet physiology that the lab is studying
   include:

   Integrin structure and activation. Integrins (including aIIbb3) are
   transmembrane glycoprotein receptors. Through site-directed
   mutagenesis, molecular dynamics, electron microscopy and x-ray
   crystallography studies, the lab is studying the mechanisms by which
   the receptors undergo a transition from an inactive to an active
   conformation with high affinity for ligands. Most recently, nanodisc
   technology coupled with electron microscopy and three-dimensional
   reconstruction have been employed to address these questions.

   High throughput screening and structure-guided design. The Coller lab
   identified a single compound out of more than 33,000 tested that
   inhibits ligand binding to aIIbb3. Structure-guided modifications of
   this led to a compound (RUC-2) that is approximately 100 times more
   potent. This compound was modified to improve aqueous solubility and is
   being developed for pre-hospital therapy for myocardial infarction.

   Platelet TGF-b1. The Coller lab discovered that platelet TGF-b1, a
   potent modifier of gene transcription and cellular behavior, can be
   activated by shear forces, and studies are under way to assess the
   biological significance of this finding in model systems and human
   diseases, including aortic stenosis.

CAREER

   Dr. Coller received his B.A. from Columbia University in 1966 and his
   M.D. from the New York University School of Medicine in 1970. He
   completed his residency in internal medicine at Bellevue Hospital in
   New York City and received advanced training in hematology and clinical
   pathology at the National Institutes of Health. He was at Stony Brook
   University from 1976 to 1993, and from 1993 to 2001 he served as a
   professor of medicine and chairman of the department of medicine at
   Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Dr. Coller came to Rockefeller in 2001
   as the first David Rockefeller Professor, head of the Laboratory of
   Blood and Vascular Biology, physician in chief of The Rockefeller
   University Hospital and vice president for medical affairs. Dr. Coller
   also serves as principal investigator of the university's Clinical and
   Translational Science Award, director of The Rockefeller University
   Center for Clinical and Translational Science and director of the
   Center for Basic and Translational Research on Disorders of the
   Digestive System.

   Dr. Coller received the Pasarow Award in 2005, the Warren Alpert
   Foundation Award in 2001 and a National Research Achievement Award from
   the American Heart Association in 1998. He is a member of the Institute
   of Medicine, the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy
   of Arts and Sciences. Dr. Coller is a past president of the American
   Society of Hematology and was founding president of the Society for
   Clinical and Translational Science.

   Dr. Coller is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
