   Hironori Funabiki

   During mitosis, a full set of chromosomes must be equally distributed
   to the offspring of each dividing cell, and failure to do so can result
   in numerous disorders, including birth defects and tumor progression.
   The Funabiki lab studies how chromosomes signal to spatially and
   temporally orchestrate a precise series of mitotic events to ensure
   accurate chromosome segregation.

   A mitotic cell undergoes a series of dramatic morphological changes,
   including chromosome condensation, spindle formation, chromosome
   segregation and cytokinesis. These events must occur at the right
   place, at the right time, in the right order. In particular, the
   Funabiki lab studies the following subjects.

   Spatial control of chromosome-induced signals during mitosis. The
   Funabiki lab has demonstrated that mitosis-specific phosphorylation of
   histone H3, the major component of chromosomes, plays a key role in
   formation of the spindle, a cellular apparatus to segregate
   chromosomes. They have shown that Survivin, whose expression is
   implicated in cancer development, binds histone H3 that is
   phosphorylated at the threonine 3 residue (H3T3ph). This binding
   results in recruitment and activation of the kinase Aurora B, which
   leads to spindle assembly around chromosomes. At the end of mitosis,
   chromosomes must stop supporting the spindle assembly and initiate
   nuclear envelope assembly. However, the nuclear envelope should not
   reform before completion of chromosome segregation, and thus the timing
   of this conversion must be accurately controlled. The Funabiki lab has
   shown that dephosphorylation of H3T3ph plays a key role in this
   process, and they revealed the molecular mechanism behind the
   spatiotemporal control of this phosphorylation. Furthermore, they have
   identified a novel chromatin-associated regulator of microtubule
   dynamics, Dppa2, which plays a critical role in controlling the proper
   size and shape of the nucleus. Through these studies, Dr. Funabiki aims
   to understand the mechanisms by which the precise order of events
   during mitosis is controlled by chromatin-induced signals.

   Mechanical control that transduces microtubule attachment into the
   chemical signal to permit chromosome separation. In order to segregate
   chromosomes, microtubules must attach to the proteinaceous structure,
   the kinetochore, which is built on each centromere of chromosomes.
   Importantly, until all the kinetochores attach to microtubules in the
   right orientation, unattached kinetochores activate a signaling pathway
   called the "spindle assembly checkpoint" to delay sister chromatid
   separation and exit from mitosis. Dr. Funabiki aims to understand the
   mechanism by which the microtubule attachment event can be converted
   into checkpoint silencing. In addition, using superresolution
   microscopy, they are studying how the three-dimensional architecture of
   the kinetochore is modulated by microtubule attachment status.

   Roles of histone modifications during the cell cycle. Upon entry into
   mitosis, chromosomes show dramatic structural changes accompanied with
   histone modifications. The functional significance of mitotic histone
   modifications remains largely unestablished due to technical
   difficulties. Devising a novel method to manipulate histone
   modifications in frog egg extracts, the Funabiki lab examines the role
   of histone modification in regulating chromatin and intracellular
   architectures during the cell cycle.

CAREER

   Dr. Funabiki received his bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1990 and
   his Ph.D. in cell biology in 1995, both from Kyoto University in Japan.
   From 1996 until 2000 he worked as a postdoc in the physiology
   department at the University of California, San Francisco, and then at
   Harvard University as a postdoc in molecular and cellular biology. He
   came to Rockefeller as assistant professor and head of the Laboratory
   of Chromosome and Cell Biology in 2002 and was promoted to associate
   professor in 2007 and professor in 2014.

   Dr. Funabiki received the Alexandrine and Alexander L. Sinsheimer Fund
   Scholar Award and the Irma T. Hirschl/Monique Weill-Caulier Trusts
   Research Award in 2003. He received the Searle Scholar Award from the
   Chicago Community Trust in 2002. He was a special fellow of the
   Leukemia and Lymphoma Society from 1999 to 2002 and a Leukemia and
   Lymphoma Society fellow from 1996 to 1999.

   Dr. Funabiki is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
