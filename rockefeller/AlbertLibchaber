Faculty Bio

   Albert Libchaber

   When considered from a broad perspective, many events that appear to
   occur at random, such as weather systems, are in fact part of recurring
   patterns and as such are subject to mathematical principles. Dr.
   Libchaber applies a type of mathematics called nonlinear dynamics to
   biological systems in order to understand how an object and its
   surrounding environment act on one another to provide a specific
   result.

   Dr. Libchaber studies mathematical patterns in biology at the
   organismal, cellular and molecular levels. At the organismal level, his
   work examines the interactions and dynamics between organism and
   environment, including the effects of moving boundary conditions on
   fluid flow. A moving fish, for example, involves a complicated
   interaction of a dynamic object with the surrounding fluid, with forces
   by both elements acting on one another. In the lab, Dr. Libchaber, in
   collaboration with researchers at New York University's Courant
   Institute of Mathematical Sciences, studied a system of flexible
   filaments in a flowing soap film, which mimics a fish moving in water.
   Working with Escherichia coli bacteria, Dr. Libchaber has recently
   shown how temperature and oxygen gradients as well as bacterial
   concentrations finely tune and control the bacteria's motility and
   genetics. The research firmly established that an organism's
   environment affects its genes and behavior.

   Dr. Libchaber's lab has also undertaken a series of experiments at the
   single-molecule level to define the minimal conditions needed to
   produce an artificial cell. Within a phospholipid vesicle, which mimics
   a cell membrane, Dr. Libchaber places DNA containing the necessary
   genes and their regulatory sequences. This cell, which is in contact
   with a feeding solution through its semipermeable membrane, is then the
   environment for testing different gene networks and elementary logic
   circuits for their ability to reproduce essential events in a cell's
   life, such as producing proteins and transporting them to the cell's
   surface. The research may hold clues to the origin of life, and the
   ultimate aim is to produce an artificial cell that self-reproduces
   following a genetic program.

   Another important concept concerning the origin of life is the
   development of a genetic code that relates the 20-amino acid world to
   the four-nucleotide one. Dr. Libchaber has recently shown that an RNA
   molecule of a stem-loop structure, acting as a ribozyme, can load an
   amino acid to its 3' end. This amino acid corresponds to the anticodon
   in the loop, and this whole process can be done without enzymes.

   Past research in Dr. Libchaber's lab has elucidated the effects of
   temperature on DNA. In a detailed study on the effects of
   thermophoresis on DNA in solution, they found that when far infrared
   lights are focused on the center of a chamber, DNA within the chamber
   moves from a hot region to a cold one. As the heat is increased,
   however, convection sets in and causes the opposite: The DNA collects
   and accumulates in the bottom center of the chamber. Because this
   phenomenon could be used to sustain very high concentrations of DNA or
   proteins, it sheds light on how critical concentrations of DNA may have
   been reached amid early primordial-soup chain reactions and therefore
   played an important role in early life forms. Then the laboratory
   showed that polymerase chain reaction, DNA amplification, is
   essentially a thermal convection process.

CAREER

   Born in Paris, Dr. Libchaber received his undergraduate degree in
   mathematics from the University of Paris in 1956. In 1959 he received
   his M.S. in physics from the University of Illinois and in 1965 earned
   his Ph.D. in physics from the École Normale Supérieure at the
   University of Paris. Dr. Libchaber was a member of the technical staff
   at the Bell Telephone Laboratory from 1965 to 1966 and was invited back
   for each of the next five consecutive summers, from 1967 to 1972. In
   1974 he became research director at the French National Center of
   Scientific Research in Paris. He moved to the University of Chicago's
   department of physics and James Franck and Enrico Fermi Institutes as a
   professor in 1983. From 1991 to 1994 he was a professor in the
   department of physics at Princeton University, before coming to
   Rockefeller in 1994.

   In 1999 Dr. Libchaber was awarded the Prix des Trois Physiciens from
   the Foundation of France. He received both the Wolf Foundation Prize in
   Physics and a John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Fellowship
   in 1986. He is a member of the French Academy of Sciences, the American
   Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences.

   Dr. Libchaber is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
