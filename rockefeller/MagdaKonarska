   M. Konarska

   The first step in the synthesis of proteins is transcription of RNA.
   But in all eukaryotes, between the time when RNA is made and when it is
   translated into proteins, it often undergoes a process called splicing,
   when certain parts of the RNA (called introns) are cut out and the
   remaining sequences (called exons) are joined back together. How RNA
   splicing occurs, and the interplay between splicing and transcription,
   is the subject of Dr. Konarska's research.

   Using a combination of yeast genetics and biochemistry, Dr. Konarska is
   interested in what happens to messenger RNA before and as it is
   spliced. More specifically, her laboratory is interested in how the
   spliceosome (the large complex responsible for splicing catalysis,
   composed of hundreds of proteins and five small RNA molecules) is
   formed and how it functions; i.e., what happens at the catalytic center
   of the spliceosome during the removal of introns. Dr. Konarska also
   examines the connection between RNA transcription and splicing.

   Multiple interactions between the different proteins and RNAs of the
   spliceosome are important for creating an active catalytic site for
   splicing. The splicing process requires a series of conformational
   rearrangements of the spliceosome that affect its assembly, catalysis
   and disassembly. In collaboration with Charles Query at the Albert
   Einstein College of Medicine, Dr. Konarska has recently formulated a
   two-state model of spliceosome function, according to which structural
   conformations that define the two catalytic steps exist in competition
   with one another. This model suggests remarkable similarities between
   the mechanism of function of the ribosome (another large
   ribonucleoprotein complex, which catalyzes protein synthesis) and the
   spliceosome. In both cases, equilibrium between conformational states
   can be modulated by many factors, including, but not limited to,
   specific contacts between the RNA substrate and the enzyme.

   The spliceosome is able to act on suboptimal splice sites, especially
   in higher eukaryotes, but to an extent also in yeast. According to the
   two-state model of spliceosome function, selection of suboptimal sites
   may be improved by many factors that modulate the relative stabilities
   of conformational states of the spliceosome. Many mutated forms of
   various spliceosomal proteins affect splicing in this way, as may
   alternative splicing factors that improve splicing of certain entire
   classes of introns. A separate project in the lab looks at other
   molecules (RNA or small chemical molecules) that stabilize specific
   conformations of the spliceosome. These molecules would functionally
   resemble ribosomal antibiotics that inhibit translation by binding to
   the ribosome and stabilizing one of the two alternative conformations.
   Once identified, such "splicing antibiotics" would provide tools for
   biochemical and structural studies of the spliceosome and may have
   therapeutic applications.

   Although Dr. Konarska's research addresses the basic function of the
   spliceosome and the mechanism of splicing catalysis in yeast, these
   findings elucidate general properties of splicing in all eukaryotes,
   including humans. Therefore, these results help scientists understand
   not only the splicing of canonical introns, but also of those that
   undergo the alternative splicing typical of mammalian cells. In this
   way, Dr. Konarska's research may help uncover the etiology of multiple
   genetic disorders resulting from changes in alternative splicing
   patterns of specific gene transcripts. In addition, a better
   understanding of RNA splicing may shed light on the origins of life, as
   some models propose that the earliest organisms used RNA or an RNA-like
   molecule rather than DNA as their genetic material.

CAREER

   Dr. Konarska was born in Poland and received her M.Sc. in genetics from
   the University of Warsaw in 1979. In 1983, she received her Ph.D. in
   biochemistry from the Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the
   Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw. She joined the Center for Cancer
   Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as a
   postdoc in 1984 and became a research associate at MIT in 1987. Dr.
   Konarska came to The Rockefeller University as assistant professor in
   1989 and became associate professor in 1994 and professor in 2000.

   In 1992, Dr. Konarska received the Monique Weill-Caulier Career
   Scientist Award. She received the Lucille P. Markey Scholar Award in
   1987 and the Jakub Karol Parnas Award of the Polish Biochemical Society
   in 1985.

   Dr. Konarska is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
