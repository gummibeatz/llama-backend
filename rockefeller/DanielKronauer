   Daniel Kronauer

   Social insects, like ants, bees, wasps and termites, live in highly
   complex societies with sophisticated social behavior, communication and
   division of labor. Members of Dr. Kronauer's laboratory use an
   integrative approach to understand how natural selection shapes the
   evolution of insect societies and how social life is regulated at
   different hierarchical levels: the gene, the individual and the colony.

   Insect societies are socially integrated to such an extent that they
   are often portrayed as "superorganisms" in which different
   morphological or behavioral castes have different functions, similar to
   the different tissues of an organism. The networks of mutually attuned
   specialists have enabled social insects to evolve to ecological
   dominance in many terrestrial ecosystems. Most fundamentally, some
   individuals, the workers, often completely forego egg laying and
   dedicate their lives to colony maintenance, while others, the queens,
   monopolize reproduction.

   Dr. Kronauer uses ants as model systems to study different aspects of
   social behavior and evolution. His current research focuses on army
   ants, a large group of nomadic predatory ants that are of particular
   ecological importance in tropical rainforests around the world. He
   studies a variety of species in the field as well as under controlled
   conditions in the laboratory.

   One of the goals of Dr. Kronauer's research group is to understand the
   evolution of social insect mating systems and how the genetic
   composition of insect societies affects colony performance and shapes
   the evolution of individual behavior. Dr. Kronauer has found that army
   ant queens mate with more males than the queens of any other type of
   ant, which results in genetically highly diverse colonies. High genetic
   diversity might be adaptive in the largest and most complex insect
   societies because it increases colony-level resistance against pathogen
   infections, improves colony homeostasis and facilitates effective and
   complex division of labor within the worker force. In at least one army
   ant species, genetic diversity is achieved by colonies with multiple
   reproductive queens, rather than by single queens that mate with many
   males. Ongoing research in the lab also focuses on species that
   reproduce asexually, which is rare among ants and can result in
   colonies with genetically identical individuals. Several projects aim
   at unraveling the genetic mechanisms and social consequences of such
   idiosyncratic reproductive systems in ants.

   Another line of investigation in the Kronauer lab addresses the
   molecular basis of social behavior and division of labor. In social
   insects, developmental trajectories, adult physiology and individual
   behavior are highly dynamic and contingent upon the social environment.
   A major challenge is to understand how the social environment is
   perceived by an individual, how the social environment interacts with
   an individual's genome to govern gene expression, how this affects
   individual physiology and behavior and how the altered individual state
   in turn feeds back into the social environment of the colony. To
   address these questions, researchers in the Kronauer lab use molecular
   genetic techniques, experimental manipulations and quantitative
   behavioral assays under controlled laboratory conditions. In
   particular, the Kronauer lab is developing and using the clonal raider
   ant Cerapachys biroi as a new model system for social behavioral
   genetics.

   Finally, Dr. Kronauer's lab also studies the manifold interactions
   between ants and other organisms. For example, the large societies of
   army ants constitute a rich resource for a variety of arthropods. A
   single army ant species, Eciton burchellii, is known to harbor over 300
   species of arthropods, including mites, bristletails, wingless flies
   and beetles. These species are entirely restricted to their host
   colonies, and beyond scattered taxonomic descriptions, essentially
   nothing is known about this microcosm. Dr. Kronauer and his
   collaborators employ DNA barcoding and imaging techniques to inventory
   army ant symbionts. They also use population genetics and chemical
   analyses to study symbiont life history, adaptation and coevolution
   with the ants.

CAREER

   Dr. Kronauer received his diploma in biology from the University of
   Würzburg in Germany in 2003, where he studied with Bert Hölldobler. He
   received his Ph.D. in 2007 from the University of Copenhagen in
   Denmark, where he worked with Koos Boomsma. After a brief postdoctoral
   assignment at the University of Lausanne, he was elected as a junior
   fellow to the Harvard Society of Fellows in 2008. Dr. Kronauer joined
   The Rockefeller University as assistant professor in 2011.

   He was named a Searle Scholar and received an NIH Director's New
   Innovator Award in 2012. In 2013, Dr. Kronauer received an Irma T.
   Hirschl/Monique Weill-Caulier Trusts Research Award. Dr. Kronauer is a
   2013 Kavli Fellow.

   Dr. Kronauer is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
