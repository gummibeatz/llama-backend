Faculty Bio

   Winrich Freiwald

   Our visual perception of the outer world is the creation of active
   brain processes that structure and select the information provided by
   the eyes. Dr. Freiwald is interested in the neural processes that form
   object representations as well as those that allow attention to make
   those representations available for cognition.

   The brain processes sensory information received by the eyes to form
   our perceptual world of objects within a three-dimensional space.
   Object representations combine information on attributes such as shape,
   color and direction of motion. To understand the mechanisms that
   control these processes, Dr. Freiwald's lab focuses on face recognition
   and attention and uses a range of techniques, including functional
   brain imaging and electrophysiology.

   Faces are a special category of objects that are of high social and,
   therefore, emotive and cognitive relevance. Using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI), Dr. Freiwald codiscovered a specialized
   neural machinery for face processing located in the temporal and
   frontal lobes of the brain. By combining fMRI with electrophysiological
   techniques, he and his colleagues further showed that this machinery is
   composed of a small network of a fixed number of face selective
   regions, termed face patches, each dedicated to a different aspect of
   face processing and all closely connected with each other. Because the
   system is specialized to process one class of complex forms, and
   because its computational components are spatially segregated, the face
   patch system offers a unique opportunity to dissect the neural
   mechanisms underlying form perception.

   Dr. Freiwald's laboratory aims to understand the inner workings of this
   system, from the level of individual cells to the interactions of brain
   areas, in order to answer questions such as: How does face selectivity
   emerge in a single cell? How is information transformed from one face
   patch to another? What is the contribution of each face patch to
   different face recognition abilities like the recognition of a friend
   or a smile? How do the different face patches interact in different
   tasks? And how is information extracted from a patch when a perceptual
   decision is made?

   While the face processing system is used as a model system to
   understand general object recognition mechanisms, the system also
   allows fundamental computational questions to be addressed, including:
   Why is visual information processing organized in hierarchies? How do
   populations of neurons represent features? And how does activity
   propagate through the cortex? By studying how the face processing
   system is embedded in the brain, the Freiwald lab aims to connect it to
   social behaviors and thereby contribute to understanding disturbances
   of such behaviors in disease.

   The Freiwald lab is also interested in how attentional control is
   exerted, how it interacts dynamically with the environment, and how
   attention interplays with sensory object representations. Vision is an
   active process, and attention is the key active ingredient that selects
   whatever is relevant for a behavioral goal and dismisses what is not.
   Dr. Freiwald is using fMRI to determine the entire network of areas
   involved in attention and identify its connections and functional
   properties. Using a spatial attention and motion discrimination task,
   the group has identified one network that includes a new cortical area
   not previously suspected to be involved in attention. Faces, due to
   their high social importance, give rise to specific attentional
   deployments, and the Freiwald lab aims to utilize this link to better
   elucidate general attention mechanisms.

CAREER

   Dr. Freiwald, a native of Oldenburg, Germany, performed his graduate
   work at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Frankfurt and
   received his Ph.D. from Tübingen University in 1998. He then joined the
   Institute for Brain Research at the University of Bremen as a research
   assistant. Starting in 2001, he worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the
   Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Massachusetts General Hospital,
   Harvard Medical School and the Hanse Institute for Advanced Study in
   Delmenhorst, Germany. He was head of the primate brain imaging group at
   the Centers for Advanced Imaging and Cognitive Sciences in Bremen from
   2004 to 2008 and a visiting associate at the California Institute of
   Technology in 2009. He joined The Rockefeller University as assistant
   professor in 2009. Dr. Freiwald was named a Pew Scholar in 2010 and a
   McKnight Scholar in 2011; he also received an Esther and Joseph
   Klingenstein Fellowship in 2010, a Sinsheimer Scholarship in 2010 and
   an Irma T. Hirschl/Monique Weill-Caulier Trusts Research Award in 2009.
