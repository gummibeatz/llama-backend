Faculty Bio

   Nam-Hai Chua

   Because they can't pick up and move, plants must react rapidly to
   changes in their environment. To do this requires a complex network of
   signaling pathways, and Dr. Chua is working at the molecular level to
   understand how some of these pathways work.

   Using Arabidopsis as a model, Dr. Chua's lab employs a combination of
   genetic, molecular and biochemical techniques -- including
   transcriptome analysis, mutant screens and transgenic plants -- to
   investigate how plants respond to abiotic and biotic signals and
   stresses at the molecular level.

   Water, nitrogen and phosphate are some of the most important
   environmental stimuli for plants. Molecular responses to these factors
   are integral to the regulation of a plant's development. Plant
   homeostasis is maintained by phytohormones and signaling molecules.
   Changes in water and nutrient availability can modulate hormone and
   signaling pathways, resulting in complex physiological and
   developmental responses. Members of the Chua lab are focusing on
   identifying the molecular mechanisms of these responses, including
   identifying signaling pathway intermediates and changes in expression
   due to epigenetic factors, such as chromatin modifications and
   noncoding RNAs.

   In addition to this, members of the Chua lab are investigating the role
   of long noncoding RNAs in plant stress response. Recently, Dr. Chua's
   lab has found that the Arabidopsis genome encodes around 8,000 long
   intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) and 36,000 natural antisense
   transcripts (NATs) whose functions await identification. Current effort
   is directed toward the characterization of genes involved in the
   biogenesis and regulation of lincRNAs and NATs and the elucidation of
   the functions of these noncoding RNAs.

   Prior work in Dr. Chua's lab established several of the basic tools
   necessary to conduct molecular research in plants. One of those tools
   is a highly controllable and chemically inducible plant gene expression
   system that allows researchers to turn transgenes on and off as
   desired. Using this system, Dr. Chua found key proteins involved in the
   plant's response to the light/dark transition. Dr. Chua's research has
   also identified proteins that play a role in a plant's reaction to
   drought. The lab has constructed different transgenic mutants that are
   more tolerant of drought conditions and can resume growth when water is
   no longer a limiting factor.

   Learning how plants' protein intermediates act and understanding the
   roles of their modifications in signaling will lead to strategies by
   which scientists may manipulate plant genetics in order to fortify
   crops against viral infection, drought, flood, pests and other
   suboptimal conditions. The knowledge generated by Dr. Chua through the
   use of Arabidopsis can be applied toward crop improvement to reduce
   hunger around the world as well as to create sustainable agriculture in
   regions of the world that are today poorly suited to it.

CAREER

   Dr. Chua was born in Singapore and earned his B.S. in botany and
   biochemistry from the University of Singapore in 1965 and his A.M. and
   Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1967 and 1969, respectively. He was a
   lecturer in biochemistry at the University of Singapore Medical School
   from 1969 to 1971. Dr. Chua joined Rockefeller in 1971 as a research
   associate in cell biology and was named assistant professor in 1973,
   associate professor in 1977, professor in 1981 and Andrew W. Mellon
   Professor in 1988.

   Dr. Chua was awarded the Lawrence Bogorad Award for Excellence in Plant
   Biology Research by the American Society for Plant Biologists in 2010,
   the International Prize in Biology from the Japan Society for the
   Promotion of Science in 2005, the Singapore Public Administration Gold
   Medal in 2002 and the Singapore National Science and Technology Gold
   Medal in 1998. Dr. Chua is an elected member of the Academia Sinica
   (Taiwan), a fellow of The Royal Society and a foreign member of the
   Chinese Academy of Sciences. He is an honorary member of the Japan
   Biochemical Society and the Japanese Society of Plant Physiologists.

   Dr. Chua is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
