Faculty Bio

   Günter Blobel

   Among the cell's diverse transport channels, nuclear pore complexes are
   by far the largest and most versatile, consisting of approximately 30
   distinct proteins known as nucleoporins. Current efforts in the Blobel
   lab aim to elucidate nuclear pore complex structure at atomic
   resolution.

   Nuclear pore complexes have a mass of over 100 million Daltons, two
   orders of magnitude larger than any other cellular channel. They are
   also highly versatile, because transport substrates include both
   proteins and nucleoproteins. Moreover, transport through the nuclear
   pore complex is selective and bidirectional. And with approximately
   1,000 copies per nucleated cell, nuclear pore complexes are among the
   most abundant channels in multicellular organisms -- humans with
   approximately 10^ 12 cells have around 10^15 nuclear pore complexes.
   Not surprisingly, malfunctioning of nuclear pore complexes and
   nucleo-cytoplasmic transport gives rise to numerous diseases. The term
   "nuclear pore complex" was introduced in 1958 by Michael Watson,
   working in the Rockefeller University laboratory of Keith Porter and
   George Palade.

   Because of the eight-fold symmetry of the nuclear pore complex, each of
   the nucleoporins occurs in multiples of eight copies. The Blobel lab is
   working to elucidate nuclear pore complex structure at atomic
   resolution. Toward this goal, nucleoporins (or segments thereof, termed
   "protomers") are expressed in bacterial cells, purified, crystallized
   and analyzed by x-ray crystallography. Protomers are also assembled and
   investigated by cryo-electron microscopy. Structural studies are
   augmented by biophysical and cell biological approaches. Similar
   approaches are employed to analyze interactions between transport
   factors and nucleoporins.

   The crystallographic and biophysical data of the Blobel laboratory on
   protomers of three "channel" nucleoporins (Nup54, Nup58 and Nup62) have
   provided new insights into the mechanism of opening and closing of the
   central transport channel of the nuclear pore complex. A key discovery
   was that a given segment, each of nucleoporin Nup54 and Nup58, form
   oligomeric assemblies of different conformations. Twenty-four
   conformers (homo-tetramers) assemble into three small, eight-membered
   rings (closed channel); eight other conformers (hetero-dodecamers)
   assemble into a single large ring (open channel). The transition
   between three small rings and a single large ring (the "ring cycle")
   changes the diameter of the central transport channel by as much as 40
   nanometers, enough to allow for the passage of a large ribosomal
   subunit or a virus.

   This ring cycle is regulated by transport factor occupancy of a
   non-structured region of Nup58, whereby cargo-occupied transport
   factors serve both as ligands and the transport substrate. Ligand
   binding provides the energy for stabilizing "dilated" conformers
   (hetero-dodecamers); below a threshold of occupied ligand binding
   sites, "constricted" conformers (homo-tetramers) prevail and keep the
   channel in a closed form.

CAREER

   A native of Germany, Dr. Blobel received his M.D. from the University
   of Tübingen in 1960 and his Ph.D. in 1967 from the University of
   Wisconsin, Madison, where he worked with Van R. Potter in the McArdle
   Laboratory for Cancer Research. He did postdoctoral work at The
   Rockefeller University in the laboratory of George E. Palade and has
   been at the university since then. He was named the John D. Rockefeller
   Jr. Professor in 1992 and became an investigator at the Howard Hughes
   Medical Institute in 1986.

   Dr. Blobel was the 1999 recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or
   Medicine for his discovery that proteins have intrinsic signals that
   govern their transport and localization in the cell. He also received
   the King Faisal International Prize in 1996, the Albert Lasker Award
   for Basic Medical Research in 1993, the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize in
   1989 and the Gairdner Foundation International Award in 1982. He is a
   member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical
   Society, the Pontifical Academy of Sciences and the German Order of
   Merit. He was awarded an honorary degree from The Rockefeller
   University in 2013.

   Dr. Blobel is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
