Faculty Bio

   David Ho

   Dr. Ho's laboratory had long focused on the pathogenesis of HIV
   infection, with particular emphasis on the dynamics of HIV replication
   in vivo. Currently, his group is pursuing the development of vaccines
   for HIV as well as other innovative prevention strategies. Dr. Ho is
   also heading the China AIDS Initiative to address the HIV/AIDS crisis
   in China.

   Dr. Ho has been actively engaged in AIDS research for 33 years and has
   published more than 400 papers on the subject. Work in Dr. Ho's lab
   helped pioneer the field of quantitation of HIV in infected people. In
   the last decade, his research team extended this work and
   revolutionized the paradigm for AIDS pathogenesis by demonstrating the
   highly dynamic nature of HIV replication in vivo. Their elegant studies
   on HIV dynamics formed the foundation for combination antiretroviral
   therapy, which Dr. Ho also helped to champion. Such a treatment
   approach has transformed a death sentence to a manageable disease and
   is now being applied widely throughout the developing world.

   A major focus of the Ho lab today is the design and testing of
   candidate vaccines to induce immune responses that could block HIV
   transmission. Dr. Ho is currently pursuing multiple vaccine strategies.
   His lab members are also manipulating the viral envelope glycoprotein
   to determine whether neutralizing antibodies could be induced.

   Under a Vaccine Discovery Center grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates
   Foundation, Dr. Ho's latest focus is a unique approach to HIV
   prevention. They are studying the passive administration of a humanized
   monoclonal antibody, known as ibalizumab, that potently and broadly
   blocks HIV infection by binding to domain 2 of human CD4, the principal
   receptor for HIV. Ibalizumab is already in clinical studies in
   HIV-infected individuals, showing a good safety profile and a
   well-documented antiviral effect, and is also being studied as a
   prophylactic in uninfected subjects. In addition, his team has
   constructed second-generation forms of this antibody that have
   significantly improved antiviral potency and breadth as well as
   enhanced pharmacokinetic properties. Moreover, many bispecific
   antibodies have been constructed and tested. Several have unprecedented
   breadth and potency against HIV. Lastly, his group is also pursuing the
   use of gene transfer methods to express in vivo antibodies that might
   be of use in HIV prevention.

   Dr. Ho and colleagues are also actively studying long-acting
   antiretroviral drugs that are promising as prophylactics against HIV.

CAREER

   Dr. Ho received his undergraduate degree from the California Institute
   of Technology in 1974 and his M.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1978.
   He completed his residency in internal medicine at the University of
   California, Los Angeles, School of Medicine in 1982 and then held a
   fellowship in infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital and
   Harvard Medical School until 1985. He has held academic appointments at
   Harvard Medical School, the University of California, Los Angeles,
   School of Medicine and the New York University School of Medicine,
   where he also served as director of the Center for AIDS Research from
   1994 to 1996. Dr. Ho has been scientific director and chief executive
   officer of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center since 1990 and was
   named professor and physician at Rockefeller in 1996.

   Dr. Ho received the Edward Ahrens Award in Clinical Investigation and
   was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal in 2001. Dr. Ho received
   the Hoechst Marion Roussel Award (now the Aventis Award) in 1999, the
   Squibb Award from the Infectious Diseases Society of America in 1996,
   the New York City Mayor's Award for Excellence in Science and
   Technology in 1993 and the Ernst Jung Prize for Medicine in 1991. He
   was a scientific honoree of the New York Academy of Medicine in 1998
   and Time magazine's Man of the Year in 1996. He is also the recipient
   of 13 honorary doctorates and is a member of the California Hall of
   Fame. Dr. Ho is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,
   the Institute of Medicine and the Academia Sinica, as well as a foreign
   member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. He recently was given the
   Prince Mahidol Award in Medicine by the Kingdom of Thailand.

   Dr. Ho is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
