   Circadian (~24 hour) clocks are endogenous mechanisms that time the
   recurring, daily activities observed in most organisms. Young's
   research has shown how interactions among certain genes and their
   proteins produce molecular oscillations at the level of individual
   cells. These cellular clocks are active in most animal tissues and
   establish overt, circadian rhythms in physiology and behavior. His
   lab's findings have implications for sleep and mood disorders as well
   as dysfunctions related to the timing of gene activities underlying
   visual functions, locomotion, metabolism, immunity, learning and
   memory.

   Studies of the molecular basis for circadian rhythmicity began in the
   early 1980s in Young's laboratory at Rockefeller, and in the
   laboratories of Jeffrey Hall and Michael Rosbash at Brandeis
   University. Over the past 30 years the work of these investigators,
   which focused on the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, has shown that
   the fly's circadian clocks are formed through the actions of a small
   group of genes
   including per (period), tim (timeless), dbt (double-time, casein kinase
   1), clk (clock), cyc (cycle), sgg(shaggy), Pdp1 (PAR domain protein
   1), vri (vrille), cry  (cryptochrome) and ck2 (casein kinase 2). Six of
   these genes were first characterized in the Young laboratory, and
   mutations in any of these "clock" genes can lengthen or shorten the
   period of behavioral, physiological and molecular circadian rhythms, or
   can abolish the rhythms altogether.

   The abundance of per, tim, vri, Pdp1 and clk RNA and their encoded
   proteins changes rhythmically with a circadian period in wild-type
   flies. In addition to these RNA and protein rhythms, two of
   the proteins, TIM and PER, rhythmically shift their sub-cellular
   location. Young and his colleagues found that these two proteins
   accumulate, pair up in the cell's cytoplasm and then migrate into the
   nucleus, where their presence switches off their production by shutting
   down the per and tim genes. However, these events are timed so that PER
   and TIM are retained in the cytoplasm for a fixed interval of several
   hours. This delay promotes RNA and protein rhythms and determines the
   period of the clock.

   The circadian clock adjusts to environmental photo-cycles through the
   activities of CRY and TIM. The former protein is a novel photoreceptor
   that binds to TIM in the presence of light and promotes TIM's rapid
   degradation, pausing the clock until TIM can re-accumulate in the dark.
    Young's laboratory also discovered that the enzyme casein kinase 1
   (DBT) further regulates the pace of this 24-hour molecular clock by
   restricting the longevity of the PER protein during each circadian
   cycle, and especially by removing PER at times when TIM is absent.
   Others have recently shown that faulty interactions between casein
   kinase 1 and PER are responsible for certain heritable sleep disorders
   in humans. In fact, most of the genes composing the Drosophila clock,
   and the cycling intracellular mechanism they direct, are well conserved
   throughout the animal kingdom.

   The Young laboratory has used oligonucleotide microarrays that
   represent all 14,000 fly genes to study the gene expression programs
   regulated by the circadian clock. They have found that in
   the Drosophila head, approximately 400 to 500 genes -- about six to
   seven percent of all genes active in the head -- are expressed with a
   circadian rhythm. Genes composing this large circadian program
   influence almost every aspect of the fly's biology, and subsets of
   these genes are switched on and off with phases representing every hour
   of the day and night. When genes that compose the circadian clock are
   mutated, this program of temporally sequenced gene expression
   disappears even if environmental cycles are present, indicating that
   the temporal program is thoroughly dependent on the molecular
   oscillator.

   Recently members of the Young laboratory have identified genes that
   affect the homeostatic regulation of sleep in Drosophila. This research
   has uncovered specific neurons whose activity promotes sleep. They have
   also begun to study sleep and circadian rhythms at the genetic and
   molecular levels in humans. The latter work involves collaborative
   studies of circadian behavioral and physiological rhythms that are
   coupled to studies in the Young laboratory that assess rhythmic gene
   and protein activities established in cultured cells derived from
   patients with certain sleep and depressive disorders.

CAREER

   Dr. Young received his undergraduate degree in biology in 1971 and his
   Ph.D. in genetics in 1975, both from The University of Texas, Austin.
   Following postdoctoral work in biochemistry at the Stanford University
   School of Medicine, he was appointed assistant professor at Rockefeller
   in 1978 as part of The Rockefeller University Fellows Program. He was
   named associate professor in 1984 and professor in 1988, and from 1987
   to 1996 he was an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.
   From 1991 to 2001 Young headed the Rockefeller unit of the National
   Science Foundation's Science and Technology Center for Biological
   Timing. Young was named the university's Vice President for Academic
   Affairs and Richard and Jeanne Fisher Professor in 2004.

   Dr. Young is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a Fellow
   of the American Academy of Microbiology. He is a recipient of the 2013
   Shaw Prize in Life Science and Medicine, the 2013 Wiley Prize in
   Biomedical Science, the 2012 Canada Gairdner International Award, the
   2012 Massry Prize, the 2011 Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize for Biology or
   Biochemistry and the 2009 Neuroscience Prize of the Peter and Patricia
   Gruber Foundation.

   Dr. Young is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
