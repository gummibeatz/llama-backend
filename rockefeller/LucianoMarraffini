Faculty Bio

   Luciano Marraffini

   Dr. Marraffini investigates the molecular mechanisms by which
   CRISPR-Cas systems provide bacteria and archaea with adaptive immunity
   against viral and plasmid infections.

   Sequence-directed genetic interference pathways control gene expression
   and preserve genome integrity in all kingdoms of life. In many bacteria
   and most archaea, clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic
   repeats (CRISPRs) specify a recently discovered genetic interference
   pathway that protects cells from viruses (phages) and conjugative
   plasmids. Within CRISPR sequences, the repeats are separated by short
   spacer sequences that match phage or plasmid genomes and specify the
   targets of interference. Spacer sequences are transcribed into CRISPR
   RNAs (crRNAs) -- small RNAs that, through base-pairing interactions
   with the target sequence, guide Cas nucleases to the invasive nucleic
   acid. Upon infection, CRISPR arrays can acquire new repeat-spacer units
   that match the infecting phage or plasmid. Therefore, CRISPR-Cas
   systems provide adaptive and inheritable immunity to the bacterial
   cell. The spacer content of CRISPR arrays reflects the many different
   invaders encountered by the host and can be expanded rapidly in
   response to new ones. Accordingly, CRISPR loci constitute a "genetic
   memory" that ensures the rejection of new, returning and ever-present
   invading DNA molecules.

   Dr. Marraffini uses Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus
   pyogenes as model systems for studying CRISPR immunity. The clinical
   isolate S. epidermidis RP62a harbors a CRISPR spacer that matches the
   nickase gene (nes) present in nearly all staphylococcal conjugative
   plasmids and prevents their spread. Using this system, Dr. Marraffini
   revealed that the CRISPR-Cas machinery targets DNA, rather than RNA,
   directly. Work in the Marraffini lab also demonstrated that the S.
   pyogenes crRNA-guided Cas9 DNA nuclease constitute a formidable tool
   for genetic engineering.

   Dr. Marraffini's current research employs molecular genetic and
   biochemical approaches to analyze the genesis and function of
   CRISPR-Cas systems. He ultimately hopes to answer fundamental questions
   about how CRISPR-Cas systems destroy their targets, how the genetic
   memory is generated and how CRISPR-Cas immunity affects the evolution
   of bacteria and archaea, particularly of bacterial pathogens. By
   performing detailed analyses of the underlying molecular mechanisms of
   CRISPR immunity, he hopes to facilitate the manipulation of this
   natural pathway to develop new technologies.

CAREER

   Dr. Marraffini, a native of Argentina, received his undergraduate
   degree from the University of Rosario in Argentina in 1998 and his
   Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 2007, where he studied
   bacterial pathogenesis in the laboratory of Olaf Schneewind. He was a
   postdoc at Northwestern University from 2008 to 2010, when he joined
   Rockefeller as assistant professor.

   He is a 2012 Rita Allen Foundation Scholar and a 2011 Searle Scholar
   and is the recipient of a 2012 NIH Director's New Innovator Award, a
   2010 RNA Society Award, a 2009 Nestle Award and a 2008 Jane Coffin
   Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research fellowship.

   Dr. Marraffini is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program, the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program and
   the Tri-Institutional Ph.D. Program in Chemical Biology.
