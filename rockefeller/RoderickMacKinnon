   Roderick MacKinnon
   Ion channels catalyze the diffusion of inorganic ions down their
   electrochemical gradients across cell membranes. Because the ionic
   movements are passive, ion channels would seem to be extraordinarily
   simple physical systems, yet they are responsible for electrical
   signaling in living cells. Among their many functions, ion channels
   control the pace of the heart, regulate the secretion of hormones into
   the bloodstream, and generate the electrical impulses underlying
   information transfer in the nervous system. Dr. MacKinnon's research is
   aimed at understanding the physical and chemical principles underlying
   ion channel function.
   Ion Conduction and
   Selectivity
   Ion channels, like enzymes, have their specific substrates: potassium,
   sodium, calcium and chloride channels permit only their namesake ions
   to diffuse through their pores. Ion selectivity refers to the ability
   of channels to discriminate among ions. Without ion selectivity,
   electrical signal production in biology as we know it would be
   impossible. The MacKinnon laboratory used mutational analysis to show
   that potassium channels are tetramers of identical subunits and that
   specific "signature sequence" amino acids are responsible for potassium
   selectivity. The signature sequence is conserved in all potassium
   channels throughout nature and forms a structural unit called the
   selectivity filter.
   To understand how the selectivity filter conducts potassium ions
   rapidly and selectively, the MacKinnon lab determined the x-ray
   structures of numerous potassium channels, including the KcsA potassium
   channel at a resolution higher than 2.0 Å. The selectivity filter is a
   narrow, 12-Å-long segment of the pore that is lined with carbonyl
   oxygen atoms. These atoms act as surrogate water molecules, allowing
   potassium ions to shed their hydration shell and enter into the pore.
   The lab showed that two potassium ions bind in the selectivity filter
   at once, most likely with a single intervening water molecule. The data
   support a mechanism in which entry of a third potassium ion on one side
   of the filter is associated with concerted potassium ion exit from the
   opposite side, giving rise to efficient potassium ion conduction.
   Electrostatic repulsion between ions inside the filter prevents the
   potassium ions from binding too tightly, thus allowing them to conduct
   at a high rate.
   Dr. MacKinnon has developed methods for chemical synthesis and folding
   of a functional potassium channel in collaboration with Tom Muir, at
   Princeton University. Using these methods, they synthesized potassium
   channels with main-chain and side-chain chemical groups that do not
   occur in natural proteins. The chemical synthesis of "unnatural"
   potassium channels has shown that a specific conformation of the
   selectivity filter is important for preventing sodium conduction when
   potassium ions are not present in solution. When potassium ions are
   present, they prevent sodium conduction through competition for binding
   sites.
   Chloride channels and transporters mediate the conduction of chloride
   ions across cell membranes. To understand the chemistry of anion
   selectivity, Dr. MacKinnon and his colleagues determined the atomic
   structures of two prokaryotic and one eukaryotic member of the CLC
   chloride channel family. These anion-selective transport proteins are
   built on a completely different architectural plan than that of
   potassium channels, but they nevertheless use many of the same basic
   physical principles to catalyze selective ionic movement across the
   membrane. These principles of selective ion movement include oriented
   alpha-helical-end charges to stabilize ions inside the membrane and
   short selectivity filters containing multiple ions in a queue to
   mediate conduction. These structures have also led to an atomic model
   that explains how CLC transporters couple the counter transport of two
   chloride ions per single proton across the cell membrane.
   Ion Channel Gating
   In humans, 78 unique potassium channel genes underlie an impressive
   level of functional diversity. The different potassium channels have
   evolved the ability to open -- by a process called gating -- in
   response to different forces in their environment. Certain potassium
   channels are gated by the binding of calcium ions, specific membrane
   lipids, or G protein subunits. Others respond to mechanical
   perturbations of the membrane or changes in voltage across the
   membrane. Thus, the potassium channels control a cell's electrical
   state through many different avenues.
   To understand the atomic basis of potassium channel gating, the
   MacKinnon lab has analyzed the function and determined the structures
   of several different members of the potassium channel family. MthK is a
   prokaryotic calcium-gated potassium channel, and the BK channel is a
   eukaryotic cousin of MthK that regulates vascular and airway smooth
   muscle tone in mammals. Through studies of these channels they have
   begun to understand how the free energy of calcium binding is converted
   to mechanical work to open the pore.
   Inward rectifier potassium (Kir) channels control the resting membrane
   voltage in many neuronal and muscle cells. The lab has recently
   determined atomic structures to understand how the signaling lipid PIP2
   regulates gating in Kir2 (a lipid gated channel) and how G proteins
   regulate gating in Kir3 (a G protein gated channel). In Kir2, when PIP2
   binds to the channel it causes a large cytoplasmic domain to move 6 Å
   to a position that opens the pore. In essence, PIP2 serves as molecular
   Velcro to tether two components of the channel together, a requirement
   to open the conduction pathway. In Kir3, large G protein subunits (b
   and g subunits) bind to the channel at the intracellular interface
   where the channel meets the cell's interior. When the G protein
   subunits bind they cause a twisting of the a helices that form the
   pore's gate, and begin to open it. The structure of Kir3 with the G
   protein subunits bound complete a story that began in 1921, when Otto
   Loewi discovered that vagus nerve stimulation slows the heart rate. In
   Dr. Loewi's experiments, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine was
   released from the nerve and activated a G protein coupled receptor in
   the heart pacemaker cells. The G proteins bound to Kir3 and opened it,
   by a mechanism revealed now in atomic detail, to hyperpolarize the
   pacemaker cell membrane and slow the heart rate.
   Probably the most difficult and in many ways fascinating form of gating
   the group has studied is called voltage-dependent gating. This gating
   allows "excitable" cells to produce electrical impulses called action
   potentials: these underlie muscle contraction and nervous system
   function. Dr. MacKinnon's group has determined structures of both
   archaebacterial and eukaryotic voltage-dependent potassium (Kv)
   channels. In 2005, they published the structure of the Kv1.2 channel
   from rat, which was the first recombinant eukaryotic membrane protein
   structure ever solved by x-ray crystallography. Since, they have solved
   numerous structures to deduce mechanism. Based on these findings they
   have posited several fundamentally new ideas: (1) voltage-sensor
   domains are loosely attached to the pore at its perimeter, (2) they
   contain a helix-turn-helix element that they named the voltage-sensor
   paddle, (3) the voltage-sensor moves in intimate contact with the
   membrane, carrying with it charges within the membrane electric field,
   and (4) the voltage sensor is attached to levers that mechanically open
   and close the pore. These structures are allowing researchers to begin
   to understand how nature, through its ion channel voltage sensors, has
   evolved the analog of a `field effect transistor' to produce action
   potentials, which have permitted rapid information transfer in living
   systems. It is fascinating to realize that voltage-dependent gating,
   which at a cellular level would seem to be the most complex form of
   gating, at a molecular level might be the simplest: the voltage across
   the membrane sets up an electric field that pulls and pushes a charged
   voltage sensor that is attached to a lever that opens and closes the
   pore.
   Most recently Dr. MacKinnon's group has begun to study a different form
   of gating called mechanical gating. They would like to understand how
   mechanical forces elicit electrical signals. This form of gating
   underlies sensory detection as in touch and hearing. It also underlies
   basic physiological processes such as cell volume regulation and blood
   pressure control. Dr. MacKinnon and others have observed significant
   mechanosensitivity in the gating of certain potassium and calcium
   channels. Now they seek to understand whether mechanosensitivity is
   physiologically relevant in potassium and calcium channels. They have
   also determined atomic structures of the human TRAAK channel, which is
   strongly mechanosensitive, to understand how it transduces mechanical
   forces, and why the central nervous system expresses a mechanosensitive
   potassium channel.
   The family of potassium channels provides an incredible example of
   molecular diversity. In an attempt to understand these molecules one
   never ceases to be amazed by life's simple solutions to what at first
   appear to be complicated tasks.
