Faculty Bio

   Bruce McEwen

   Throughout life, hormones alter behavior and mood, regulate
   neuroendocrine activity, protect the brain from stress and regulate
   brain aging and certain disease processes. Dr. McEwen's laboratory
   studies how stress and sex hormones act on the brain, taking an
   interdisciplinary approach that combines behavioral analysis and
   measurements of hormone levels with neurochemical, morphological,
   neuropharmacological, cellular and molecular methodologies and
   collaborative translational studies.

   The neuroendocrine system links behavior and experience with hormone
   secretion. In turn, hormones regulate functions such as reproduction,
   fluid and mineral intake and balance, metabolism and immune activity.
   They also help shape the developing brain, affect mood and behavior and
   contribute to aging and disease. Dr. McEwen studies the cellular and
   molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of stress and sex hormones
   on neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and dendritic remodeling in the
   hippocampal region of the adult and developing brain. The hippocampus
   is involved in the formation of episodic, spatial and contextual
   memories and is one of the first brain structures to degenerate in
   Alzheimer's disease.

   In relation to sex hormone action, the McEwen lab has identified sex
   hormone receptors in the hippocampus that regulate signaling pathways
   associated with synapse formation and maturation involving regulation
   of protein synthesis, neurotransmitter release and cytoskeletal
   remodeling. These "nongenomic" forms of the classical sex hormone
   receptors work in concert with the more classical genomic actions of
   sex hormones on gene expression, and they increase excitatory synapse
   formation and exert antiseizure and neuroprotective effects in
   hippocampus and other brain regions.

   In relation to stress, the McEwen lab has found that hormone actions on
   structural plasticity are intertwined with the actions of excitatory
   amino acid transmitters, kainate receptors, serotonin, GABA, other
   neurotransmitters and BDNF. Dr. McEwen has found that, in the dentate
   gyrus, chronic stress reduces neuron number and contributes to
   cognitive impairment. In the hippocampus, chronic stress causes neurons
   to undergo remodeling of dendrites. Excitatory amino acids -- in
   particular, NMDA receptors -- are important regulators of neuronal
   remodeling, acting in concert with glucocorticoids. The lab has also
   shown that the stress-induced remodeling is largely reversed once the
   stress is removed.

   The McEwen lab has recently expanded its scope of study to investigate
   stress-induced structural remodeling in the amygdala, which is involved
   in fear and strong emotions, and the prefrontal cortex, which is
   involved in working memory, decision making and extinction of fear
   learning. Recent work has found, in humans, an effect of chronic
   perceived stress on mental flexibility and functional activity in the
   prefrontal cortex that is analogous to animal studies. In animals,
   aging leads to loss of the ability to promptly extend dendrites of the
   prefrontal cortex after cessation of stress.

   Work by the neuroimmune-physiology group, headed by Karen Bulloch, has
   revealed important cell types characteristic of the immune system,
   namely brain dendritic cells, that are present in the normal, undamaged
   brain, accumulate in the aging brain and are activated in response to
   simulated stroke and interferon-g. The group is working to characterize
   their functions.

   The McEwen laboratory has helped create a new understanding of how the
   brain changes in adult life and in development, with implications for
   understanding the impact of stress on the brain and sex differences in
   human brain function, abnormalities, Alzheimer's disease, depression,
   posttraumatic stress disorder and aging.

CAREER

   Dr. McEwen received his A.B. in chemistry from Oberlin College in 1959
   and his Ph.D. in cell biology from Rockefeller in 1964. He was a United
   States Public Health Service Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute of
   Neurobiology in Göteborg, Sweden, from 1964 to 1965 and an assistant
   professor in zoology at the University of Minnesota. Dr. McEwen
   returned to Rockefeller in 1966 as assistant professor. He was
   appointed associate professor in 1971 and professor and head of
   laboratory in 1981 and was named Alfred E. Mirsky Professor in 1999.

   Dr. McEwen is a past president of the Society for Neuroscience. He is a
   member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of
   Arts and Sciences and the Institute of Medicine. He received the 2011
   Edward M. Scolnick Prize in Neuroscience and a share of the 2010 Ipsen
   Foundation Prize in Neuronal Plasticity. In 2009 he received the Gold
   Medal award from the Society for Biological Psychiatry. In 2005 he
   received the Pasarow Award in Neuropsychiatry. He is a recipient of the
   Dale Medal of the British Endocrine Society, and in 2005 he received
   the Goldman-Rakic Prize for Cognitive Neuroscience from the National
   Alliance for Research for Schizophrenia and Depression and the Karl
   Spencer Lashley Award from the American Philosophical Society.

   Dr. McEwen is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
