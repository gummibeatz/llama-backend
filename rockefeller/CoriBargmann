   Cori Bargmann

   Environment, experience and genes interact to shape an animal's
   behavior. Caenorhabditis elegans, a worm with just 302 neurons, shows
   considerable sophistication in its behaviors, and its defined neuronal
   wiring and genetic accessibility make it an ideal subject in which to
   study these interactions. Dr. Bargmann's laboratory characterizes genes
   and neural pathways that allow the nervous system to generate flexible
   behaviors.

   How do genes and the environment interact to generate a variety of
   behaviors? How are behavioral decisions modified by context and
   experience? The Bargmann lab is studying the relationships between
   genes, experience, the nervous system and behavior in the nematode C.
   elegans. C. elegans has a very simple nervous system that consists of
   just 302 neurons with reproducible functions, morphologies and synaptic
   connections. Despite this simplicity, many of the genes and signaling
   mechanisms used in the nematode nervous system are similar to those of
   mammals. The ability to manipulate the activity of individual genes and
   neurons in C. elegans makes it possible to determine how neural
   circuits develop and function.

   C. elegans's most complex behaviors occur in response to smell, and
   these are at the heart of the Bargmann lab's research. The tiny worm
   can sense hundreds of different odors, discriminate among them and
   generate reactions that are appropriate to the odor cue. Since its
   nervous system is so simple, it's possible for researchers to determine
   how individual neurons contribute to these behaviors. In C. elegans, as
   in other animals, odors are detected by G protein coupled odorant
   receptors on specialized sensory neurons. The odors that activate one
   sensory neuron regulate a behavioral output such as attraction or
   avoidance. The lab studies the pathways from sensory input to
   behavioral output by quantitative analysis of behavior under
   well-defined conditions, genetic manipulation of individual neuronal
   cells, calcium imaging from neurons in living animals and forward and
   reverse genetic approaches.

   Dr. Bargmann is also investigating how much flexibility is present in a
   simple nervous system. For example, C. elegans is capable
   of learning the odors of different bacteria and avoiding those that
   previously made it ill. These learned olfactory behaviors are
   associated with neurochemical changes that lead to rapid behavioral
   remodeling.

   Another interest of the Bargmann laboratory is how genetic variation
   between individuals can cause them to behave differently from one
   another. In C. elegans, a single gene determines whether animals prefer
   to eat alone or in social groups. This gene encodes a neuropeptide
   receptor, a modulator that integrates multiple sensory inputs to
   generate coordinated behaviors. A current focus of Dr. Bargmann's
   research is on learning how modulatory systems, like this neuropeptide
   receptor, affect the flow of information between neurons.

CAREER

   Dr. Bargmann received her undergraduate degree in biochemistry from the
   University of Georgia. She received her Ph.D. in 1987 from the
   Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where she worked under
   Robert A. Weinberg at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research.
   She pursued a postdoctoral fellowship with H. Robert Horvitz, also at
   MIT, until 1991, when she accepted a faculty position at the University
   of California, San Francisco. She remained there until 2004, when she
   joined Rockefeller as the Torsten N. Wiesel Professor. Dr. Bargmann
   also is codirector of the Shelby White and Leon Levy Center for Mind,
   Brain and Behavior. She has been an investigator at the Howard Hughes
   Medical Institute since 1995.

   Dr. Bargmann is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the
   American Philosophical Society and the American Academy of Arts and
   Sciences. She received the 2013 Breakthrough Award in Life Sciences,
   the 2012 Kavli Prize in Neuroscience, the 2012 Dart/NYU Biotechnology
   Achievement Award, the 2009 Richard Lounsbery Award from the U.S. and
   French National Academies of Sciences and the 2004 Dargut and Milena
   Kemali International Prize for Research in Basic and Clinical
   Neurosciences.

   Dr. Bargmann is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
