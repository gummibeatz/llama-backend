Faculty Bio

   Ali Brivanlou

   The union of sperm and egg, two highly differentiated cell types, gives
   rise to the zygote -- the totipotent cell. The zygote has the potential
   to form every cell type of the embryo and the adult organism through a
   series of hierarchical cell fate decisions that involves cell-cell
   interaction and signaling called embryonic induction. Dr. Brivanlou
   wants to decipher the molecular circuitry that underlies the
   establishment of discrete cell fate during early vertebrate
   embryogenesis.

   The Brivanlou lab's research focuses on the molecular events and
   cellular interactions that regulate the emergence of key structures in
   the early embryo. Most work in his laboratory focuses on the molecular
   basis of cell fate specification and patterning during early embryonic
   development. The ultimate objective is to understand the molecular
   circuitry underlying embryonic induction, with special emphasis on the
   formation of the nervous system. Toward this aim, he performs
   comparative studies using amphibian and mammalian model systems,
   including human embryonic stem cells (hESCs).

   The Brivanlou laboratory has demonstrated that the TGF-b pathway plays
   a central role in inductive interactions leading to the establishment
   of different neural fates, which begins by the specification of the
   brain. Subsequent work in vertebrates has irrevocably established the
   pivotal role of these morphogens in the formation of specialized
   tissues in the embryo. In studies of frog (Xenopus laevis) embryos, Dr.
   Brivanlou has made several influential discoveries, including that all
   embryonic cells will develop into nerve cells unless they receive
   signals directing them otherwise. A concept, coined "the default model"
   of neural induction, postulates that neural fate determination requires
   the inhibition of an inhibitory signal. His laboratory has contributed
   to the molecular and biochemical understanding of the TGF-b signaling
   pathway and cross talk with other signaling networks, using frog and
   mouse embryos and mammalian cell culture. The work led to the discovery
   of the molecular basis of epidermal, neural crest and sensory placodes
   and neural induction in comparative platforms.

   Information obtained from this work provides a strong foundation for
   research involving hESCs. To address whether the default model of
   neural induction is conserved from amphibians to mammals (and humans in
   particular), Dr. Brivanlou's laboratory was among the first to work
   directly in hESCs. With private support from the Juvenile Diabetes
   Research Foundation, Dr. Brivanlou and colleagues derived several hESC
   lines, called RUES 1, 2 and 3. Using other private funds, his group
   established an in vivo platform to study hESCs by demonstrating these
   cells integrate into the mouse embryo, migrate to the inner cell mass
   when put in close contact and divide and differentiate alongside their
   mouse counterparts, suggesting the speed of differentiation of human
   cells can be reprogrammed to match the mouse. The RUES lines were among
   the first 13 hESC lines approved for use in research funded by the
   National Institutes of Health (NIH), under the NIH Guidelines for Human
   Stem Cell Research adopted in July 2009 under the Obama administration.
   In this context, the group has recently developed new tools to perform
   reversible transgenesis in human and rhesus monkey embryonic cell
   lines, expressing a variety of reporter constructs controlled by germ
   layer and tissue-specific regulatory elements. Their current work
   focuses on the molecular dissection of the defining properties of ESCs
   -- their capacity for self-renewal and to differentiate into a range of
   cell types.

   The Brivanlou laboratory's overall goal is to use hESCs to study early
   human embryonic development. Several collaborations with Rockefeller
   University physics laboratories have also provided new insight, from
   the use of quantum dots for embryonic imaging (with Albert J.
   Libchaber) to development of new statistical tools for DNA microarray
   and high throughput proteomic analysis (with Marcelo O. Magnasco). An
   ongoing collaboration with Rockefeller's Eric D. Siggia focuses on
   using a high throughput microfluidic platform, micropatterned control
   of colony architecture and optogenetic activation of gene expression to
   program hESC differentiation toward specific fates by dynamic changes
   of the signaling landscape and without compromising genetic integrity.
   Thus, the first steps of stem cell differentiation are being
   scrutinized using new high-resolution techniques. This data will be
   organized and developed into a predictive tool to rationally reprogram
   specialized fates from hESCs.

CAREER

   Dr. Brivanlou received his doctoral degree in 1990 from the University
   of California, Berkeley, and his postdoctoral training in Douglas
   Melton's lab at Harvard University. He joined Rockefeller in 1994 as
   assistant professor. Among his many awards are the Irma T.
   Hirschl/Monique Weill-Caulier Trusts Career Scientist Award, the Searle
   Scholar Award, the James A. Shannon Director's Award from the NIH, the
   Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers and The
   Rockefeller University Teaching Award.

   Dr. Brivanlou is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
