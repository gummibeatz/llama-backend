   Joel Cohen

   Populations exhibit phenomena that are difficult to deduce from the
   characteristics of an isolated member. For example, counterintuitively,
   the proportion of elderly in a human population is more strongly
   affected by the population's birthrate than by its life expectancy. Dr.
   Cohen studies groups of living beings and their interactions, including
   people, assassin bugs, parasites of Chagas disease in Argentina and
   prey and predators in a food web, to develop concepts helpful for
   understanding populations.

   Dr. Cohen and his colleagues combine mathematical tools with
   observations of concrete problems in demography, epidemiology and
   ecology to understand populations better. His research spans studies of
   human population growth, infectious diseases and food webs.

   A major challenge in the coming decades is to understand how
   demographic, economic and cultural changes will interact with Earth's
   physical, chemical and biological environments. Dr. Cohen's laboratory
   has analyzed the spatial distribution of Earth's human population in
   relation to geophysical factors such as elevation, distance from coasts
   or navigable rivers, temperature and precipitation. As neutral experts
   for federal courts, Dr. Cohen and his colleagues developed and used
   methods to predict future claimants of asbestos-related diseases and
   injuries. Their methods may provide models for future mass-tort
   litigation as well as for long-term assessments of the impact of other
   environmental contaminants.

   Dr. Cohen also studies Chagas disease, an insect-borne infectious
   disease that is a New World relative of African sleeping sickness.
   Chronic Chagas disease afflicts millions of people in Latin America and
   has no cure. Dr. Cohen collaborates with Argentine colleagues in field
   studies of the control of Chagas disease in rural northwest Argentina.
   They have developed a mathematical model of the risk of household
   transmission to humans, which enables the indigenous population to
   reduce risks of infection by better household management.

   Because ecological communities strongly affect human well-being, Dr.
   Cohen's research extends to nonhuman species as well. One approach
   focuses on a food web, a flowchart of who eats whom that describes the
   major pathways of food energy and of chemical and biological toxins.
   Dr. Cohen and his colleagues developed a new food web graph that plots
   species and feeding links in the plane spanned by species' average body
   mass and numerical abundance. They analyzed unique data on soil food
   webs at 146 sites in the Netherlands to understand how environmental
   variables, human land uses and below-ground food webs interact.

   Dr. Cohen's laboratory also studies international migration in
   collaboration with colleagues at the United Nations Population
   Division. Newly developed mathematical and statistical models make it
   possible to account for more than half of the variability in the annual
   numbers of migrants among 229 countries or regions from 1960 to 2004.
   These models can be incorporated in deterministic or probabilistic
   population projections in combination with standard demographic
   techniques for projecting births and deaths.

   The laboratory seeks to understand how stochasticity -- random
   influences such as changes in weather or resources, or chance events of
   birth and death -- creates novel patterns in nonlinear dynamics of
   population change. Dr. Cohen and his colleagues studied contained
   populations of flour beetles, cannibalistic insects that have long been
   used to study population dynamics. From time series of counts of the
   numbers of larvae, pupae and adults in jars, the researchers derived
   "power spectra" to compare the accuracy of predictions about the beetle
   population generated by their model with that of predictions from the
   linearization methods of physics, a more traditional means of
   understanding randomly perturbed dynamical systems. In most cases,
   predictions from their model were far more successful in describing the
   experimental data.

CAREER

   Dr. Cohen earned his B.A. from Harvard University in 1965. He holds two
   doctoral degrees from Harvard: a Ph.D. in applied mathematics (1970)
   and a doctorate of public health in population sciences and tropical
   public health (1973). He taught at Harvard from 1971 until his
   appointment as professor at Rockefeller in 1975.

   Dr. Cohen was a John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Fellow
   and is a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He was a member of
   the board of trustees of the Population Reference Bureau and a member
   of the board of directors of The Nature Conservancy and cochair of its
   Science Council. He shared the Tyler Prize for Environmental
   Achievement from the University of Southern California in 1999 and the
   1997 Fred L. Soper Award for Excellence in Public Health Literature
   from the Pan American Health and Education Foundation for his work on
   Chagas disease.

   Dr. Cohen is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
