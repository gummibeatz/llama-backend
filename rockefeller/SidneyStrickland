Faculty Bio

   Sidney Strickland

   One approach for gaining insight into the complex mammalian nervous
   system is to study diseases that perturb its function at the molecular
   level. Such studies can reveal the roles of critical molecules by
   identifying those that, by their alteration or absence, cause disease.
   Dr. Strickland's lab investigates mouse models of neurological
   diseases, using genetic, cell biological and biochemical approaches to
   investigate neurovascular function, dysfunction and repair.

   Neurological disorders of the central nervous system represent profound
   medical problems worldwide. For example, Alzheimer's disease affects
   millions of people and has severe physical, psychological and financial
   consequences. By using mouse models of neurological diseases, Dr.
   Strickland is working to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which
   neural function is disrupted.

   In investigating neurovascular dysfunction, the Strickland lab
   maintains two general lines of study: the mechanisms underlying the
   pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and myotonic dystrophy.
   Cerebrovascular defects contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's
   pathology, and members of the lab are using transgenic mouse models of
   Alzheimer's to evaluate blood-brain barrier damage and the roles that
   blood clot formation and degradation play in this disease. Their
   research has determined that the amyloid-b peptide, which is considered
   to be a causative factor in Alzheimer's, interacts with fibrinogen to
   promote fibrin accumulation in the brain and increase brain
   inflammation. This peptide also alters blood clot structure and clot
   degradation, which could compromise blood flow, exacerbate inflammation
   and lead to neuronal death. These results suggest that fibrin and the
   mechanisms involved in its accumulation and clearance may present novel
   therapeutic targets for slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease.

   The Strickland lab is also interested in muscular dystrophy, an
   inherited, autosomal-dominant degenerative disorder that affects the
   muscles and many other organs of the body. Because there is currently
   no treatment, researchers have been exploring the possibility of using
   stem cells as a therapy. Pericytes, multi-origin perivascular cells
   with pluripotent activity, are able to differentiate into myogenic
   cells and generate muscle fibers in vivo, indicating their great
   potential to treat and/or cure muscular dystrophy diseases. The
   Strickland lab has found that mice deficient in pericyte laminin, an
   extracellular matrix protein that covers pericytes in physiological
   conditions but is degraded in pathological conditions, have a phenotype
   similar to that observed in myotonic patients. These results suggest
   that laminin and pericytes are important players in this disease.
   Members of the lab are investigating the regulatory roles of laminin in
   the stem cell property of pericytes. The long-term objectives of their
   studies are to generate a novel animal model of myotonic dystrophy,
   provide scientific evidence supporting pericyte-based therapy in this
   disease and identify novel molecular targets that could be manipulated
   to treat this and other muscular dystrophies.

CAREER

   Dr. Strickland received his bachelor's degree in chemistry from Rhodes
   College in Memphis in 1968 and his Ph.D. in biochemistry from the
   University of Michigan in 1972. He came to Rockefeller in 1973 as a
   research associate and was named assistant professor in 1975 and
   associate professor in 1980. He moved to Stony Brook University in 1983
   as an associate professor and was promoted to professor in 1987. He
   returned to Rockefeller in 2000 as head of the Laboratory of
   Neurobiology and Genetics and dean of graduate and postgraduate
   studies.

   Dr. Strickland received the Innovative Research Award from the
   Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation in 2009, an honorary doctor of
   science degree in 2006 from Rhodes College, a Distinguished Alumni
   Award in 2002 and a Distinguished Graduate Award from the University of
   Michigan in 2001. He was named a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial
   Foundation Fellow in 1998 and was an established investigator for the
   American Heart Association from 1981 to 1986. He received a Jane Coffin
   Childs Postdoctoral Fellowship in 1973 and a National Science
   Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship in 1970. In 2006, together with
   his daughter, Eliza Strickland, he published The Illustrated Timeline
   of Science: A Crash Course in Words and Pictures.

   Dr. Strickland is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
