   Shai Shaham

   Research in the Shaham lab focuses on two areas: the control of
   programmed cell death during animal development and the roles of glial
   cells in nervous system development and function. The Shaham lab uses
   the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in its studies and has demonstrated
   that underlying both areas of research are cellular programs conserved
   from C. elegans to humans.

   Nervous systems consist of two major cell types: neurons and glia.
   Basic properties of neurons and mechanisms governing neuronal
   development and function are well studied. However, the functions of
   glia, the most abundant cell type in vertebrate nervous systems, remain
   mostly unexplored, and few mediators of glial function are known. Glia
   are important in disease: 95 percent of brain malignancies are of glial
   character, and glial defects are associated with neurodegenerative
   diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's
   disease, suggesting that understanding glial functions, and how they go
   awry, is indispensable for comprehending brain functions and
   dysfunctions.

   One explanation for the gap in understanding glia may lie in their
   neurotrophic properties. Glial manipulation often results in neuronal
   loss, precluding investigations of other effects glia may have on
   neuronal morphogenesis or activity. The Shaham lab has discovered that
   glia of the nematode C. elegans bear striking morphological, anatomical
   and molecular similarities to vertebrate glia. Importantly, C. elegans
   glia are not required for neuronal survival, making C. elegans a unique
   model for deciphering glial roles in the nervous system and allowing,
   for the first time, manipulation of these cells in vivo without the
   complication of neuronal loss.

   The Shaham lab has shown that glia are essential for neural
   development, promoting axon outgrowth and dendrite extension, and that
   glia are required for morphological plasticity of neuronal receptive
   endings; indeed, some sensory receptive structures fail to form in
   their absence. The lab has also uncovered morphology-independent roles
   for glia in sensory neuron function, showing that animals lacking glia
   exhibit profound sensory deficits. To understand the bases of these
   functional interactions, the Shaham lab has identified glia-enriched
   proteins and studied their roles in neuronal development and function.

   Although C. elegans glia do not control neuronal survival, the Shaham
   lab has explored the death of other C. elegans cells to understand the
   principles by which vertebrate glia might control neuronal viability.
   In addition to discovering novel transcriptional and protein
   degradation-mediated controls of apoptotic cell death, the lab has
   identified a novel cell death program independent of known apoptotic
   regulators. The unique morphology accompanying this cell death program
   is conserved during development of the vertebrate nervous system. The
   Shaham lab identified many genes promoting this new cell death form,
   all of which are conserved in vertebrates, raising the possibility that
   the mechanism of this novel cell death program is also conserved.

CAREER

   Dr. Shaham received his A.B. degree in biochemistry from Columbia
   University in 1989. In 1995 he graduated from the Massachusetts
   Institute of Technology with a Ph.D. in biology. After postdoctoral
   studies at the University of California, San Francisco, Dr. Shaham
   joined Rockefeller as assistant professor in 2001 and was named
   professor in 2012.

   Dr. Shaham is a recipient of the 2009 Blavatnik Award for Young
   Scientists, a 2005 Klingenstein Fellowship Award in the Neurosciences,
   and a 2005 Breast Cancer Alliance Masin Young Investigator Award. He is
   also the recipient of the 2004 Irma T. Hirschl/Monique Weill-Caulier
   Trusts Research Award and was named scholar of both the Rita Allen
   Foundation (2003) and the Sidney Kimmel Foundation for Cancer Research
   (2002).

   Dr. Shaham is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
