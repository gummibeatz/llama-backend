Faculty Bio

   Mary Jeanne Kreek

   An estimated 25 to 33 percent of people who take a short-acting opiate
   drug -- usually heroin -- develop an addiction to it.
   This suggests that some people are naturally more vulnerable to
   addiction than others and that genetics may play a role along with
   direct drug-induced effects and environmental and psychological
   factors. Dr. Kreek investigates how genetic factors, as well as
   neurobiological alterations, factor into addictive diseases such as
   opiate addiction, nicotine addiction, cocaine dependency and
   alcoholism.

   Dr. Kreek investigates the biological basis of addictive diseases as
   well as existing and novel treatments for these conditions. Her lab
   also researches the medical complications of drug abuse, such as
   hepatitis C and AIDS. This clinical and lab-based experimental approach
   led her lab to discover in 1983 to 1984 that the second most common
   risk group for HIV-1/AIDS is parenteral drug users.

   Dr. Kreek's research focuses on the endogenous opioid system, which
   modulates stress and pain, and the roles that specific opioid peptides
   and their receptors play in normal and abnormal circumstances. Heroin
   and morphine, which mimic endogenous peptides, as well as cocaine and
   alcohol activate these opiate receptors, directly or indirectly. Dr.
   Kreek and her colleagues examine receptor and peptide function in
   animals that are given or are allowed to self-administer a drug of
   abuse in chronic or acute doses to study how this exposure impacts the
   brain's neurochemistry, neurobiology and circuitry and how to identify
   potential treatments. The lab also studies epigenetic, physiologic and
   behavioral effects of drug administration on the endogenous opioid
   system and related signaling networks. The scientists use microdialysis
   in rats and mice to conduct dynamic studies of neurotransmitter release
   and peptide processing in the brain.

   The lab studies the roles of the mu and kappa opioid receptor systems
   and vasopressin/V1b receptor systems in alcohol "binge" and
   dependent-like drinking models using rats and region-specific gene
   deficient mice. Additionally, as illicit use of oxycodone in
   adolescence has become a pressing public health problem, the lab is
   investigating the behavior and neurobiological changes that occur in
   adolescent versus adult mice during and after self-administration of
   oxycodone. In collaboration with Rockefeller's F. Nina Papavasiliou,
   the group is developing a vaccine to prevent progression from oxycodone
   use to addiction using a novel platform for small-molecule vaccines.
   The lab also focuses on the development and study of novel potential
   medications that may be of value in the treatment of addictive diseases
   and co-occurring mental health diseases using a translational approach;
   k opioid ligands are of particular interest.

   Components underlying the neurobiology of addictive diseases are the
   focus of clinical studies, including how neuropeptides affect cocaine
   and heroin addicts, former opiate addicts maintained on methadone and
   patients dependent on alcohol, nicotine or both. Polymorphisms of genes
   that may play a role in addiction or genes that may alter responses to
   medications (pharmacogenetics) and affect normal physiology
   (physiogenetics) are identified. The lab identified and characterized a
   functional single-nucleotide polymorphism in the µ opioid receptor,
   which increases vulnerability to develop opioid and alcohol addictions
   and significantly alters stress responsivity in healthy subjects. Their
   more recent work identified functional polymorphisms of the dynorphin
   gene. Examinations of different ethnic populations have also revealed
   that other specific polymorphisms may have a greater association with
   addictive disorders.

   Dr. Kreek is well known for her pioneering work in the development of
   methadone maintenance therapy for heroin addiction in the 1960s, a
   therapy that has become common practice throughout the world. She also
   was one of the first to document that drugs of abuse significantly
   alter expression of specific genes in specific brain tissues and alter
   normal perceptions of reward and dysphoria.

CAREER

   Dr. Kreek received her B.A. from Wellesley College in 1958 and her M.D.
   from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1962.
   She (and also the late Marie Nyswander) joined Rockefeller in the
   laboratory of Vincent Dole in 1964.

   Dr. Kreek received the Wellesley Alumnae Achievement Award in 2012, a
   Laurea ad Honorem in Farmacia from the University of Bologna in 2010,
   an honorary doctorate from Tel Aviv University in 2007, the Gold Medal
   for distinguished achievements in academic medicine from the Columbia
   University College of Physicians and Surgeons Alumni Association in
   2004, an honorary doctorate from the University of Uppsala in 2000 and
   the Nathan B. Eddy Memorial Award for Lifetime Excellence in Drug Abuse
   Research and the R. Brinkley Smithers Distinguished Scientist Award in
   1999. She received a Specific Recognition Award for Research in the
   Science of Addiction from the Executive Office of the President in
   1998, and in 1996 she was given the Betty Ford Award.

   Dr. Kreek is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
