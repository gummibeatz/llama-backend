   Seth Darst

   RNA, the blueprint for proteins, is made in all cells by a complex
   molecular machine, the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Dr. Darst's
   research explores the mechanism and regulation of transcription by
   determining three-dimensional structures of RNA polymerase and
   associated proteins. The RNA polymerase is conserved from bacteria to
   humans, making the simpler bacterial version an excellent model for
   understanding how transcription and, by extension, gene expression are
   controlled.

   In its simplest bacterial form, the RNA polymerase complex is made up
   of at least four proteins, while the eukaryotic complex comprises a
   dozen individual proteins or more. However, the catalytic core of RNA
   polymerase is evolutionarily conserved among all organisms, with a very
   high retention of the basic sequence. In all cells, the RNA polymerase
   core can synthesize RNA chains from a DNA template but is unable to
   recognize promoters, specific sites within DNA where transcription
   initiates. In bacteria, a separate protein -- the s factor -- must bind
   to the RNA polymerase core to form the RNA holoenzyme, which can locate
   promoters and open the DNA for transcription.

   The Darst laboratory is purifying, crystallizing and determining the
   structures of proteins involved in transcription using a combination of
   approaches, including x-ray crystallography and electron microscopy.
   Solving these structures provides scientists with snapshots of
   different, kinetically stable states of the transcription complex,
   offering insight into the dynamic events that occur during
   transcription. As more structures are solved, they will shed light on
   the molecular mechanisms of the regulatory factors acting at different
   stages of transcription.

   Members of the Darst lab have purified, crystallized and determined the
   structure of the core RNA polymerase from the thermophilic eubacteria
   Thermus aquaticus. The results were the first high-resolution structure
   of a multisubunit cellular RNA polymerase. The lab then tracked the
   path of the transcript RNA and the template DNA through the polymerase
   structure using RNA-protein and DNA-protein cross-links, a method that
   gave the scientists a model of the elongation complex that makes RNA as
   the polymerase move along the DNA.

   The lab has also worked to understand how the introduction of specific
   molecules impacts RNA polymerase. To determine how the antibiotic
   rifampicin inhibits RNA polymerase function, Dr. Darst used a
   combination of x-ray crystallography and biochemical studies. Electron
   microscopy was used to reveal how a known regulatory factor modulates
   the transcript elongation process.

   Research from the Darst lab has also described the structure of the s
   protein, the key transcription initiation factor in bacteria. Another
   structural study by members of the lab described the
   transcription-repair coupling factor, a protein cells use to remove RNA
   polymerase molecules stalled at sites of DNA damage and to recruit
   repair proteins to fix the damage.

   Dr. Darst's studies have furthered scientists' knowledge of the
   transcription process in several ways. Structures of the RNA polymerase
   holoenzyme and holoenzyme with a promoter DNA fragment have provided
   insight into transcription initiation. In addition, high-resolution
   structures of s factor domains in complex with promoter DNA or with
   inhibitory anti-s factors have provided the basis for structural and
   functional analysis of the key regulatory factor in bacterial
   transcription.

CAREER

   Dr. Darst received his B.S. in chemical engineering from the University
   of Colorado, Boulder, in 1982. He received his M.S. in chemical
   engineering in 1984 and his Ph.D. in chemical engineering in 1987, both
   from Stanford University. Remaining at Stanford, Dr. Darst was an
   American Cancer Society Postdoctoral Fellow from 1987 to 1990 and a
   Lucille P. Markey Postdoctoral Scholar from 1990 to 1992. He came to
   Rockefeller in 1992 as assistant professor and became associate
   professor in 1997 and professor in 2000.

   Dr. Darst was named a Pew Scholar in the Biomedical Sciences in 1995
   and a Career Scientist of the Irma T. Hirschl Charitable Trust in 1994.
   He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences.

   Dr. Darst is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program, the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program and
   the Tri-Institutional Ph.D. Program in Chemical Biology.
