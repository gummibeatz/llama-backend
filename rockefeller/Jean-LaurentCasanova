Faculty Bio

   Jean-Laurent Casanova

   Dr. Casanova studies the human genetic determinism of pediatric
   infectious diseases, particularly mycobacterial diseases, invasive
   pneumococcal disease, herpes simplex encephalitis, chronic
   mucocutaneous candidiasis, severe flu and Kaposi sarcoma. He is
   interested in identifying monogenic "holes" in the immune defense of
   otherwise healthy children who are susceptible to specific infectious
   diseases, work that has profound implications for and has resulted in a
   paradigm shift in clinical medicine and fundamental immunology.

   Dr. Casanova's laboratory aims to understand what it is that makes some
   children develop a severe clinical illness in the course of infection
   while others exposed to the same microbe remain unharmed. The
   laboratory revealed that single-gene inborn errors of immunity in
   children may confer severe and selective vulnerability to certain
   infectious illnesses, whereas corresponding infections in adults result
   more from complex inheritance. This work not only blurs the distinction
   between patient-based Mendelian genetics and population-based complex
   genetics but also provides experimental support for a unified genetic
   theory of human infectious diseases.

   Since the 1950s and until recently, it was believed that mutations in a
   single gene confer vulnerability to multiple infectious diseases,
   whereas common infections have been associated with the inheritance of
   multiple susceptibility genes. Dr. Casanova and Laurent Abel identified
   and characterized new genetic defects that predispose otherwise healthy
   individuals to a single type of infection, a novel causal relationship
   that modified the paradigm that had dominated the field for decades.

   Dr. Casanova's team has identified inborn errors of immunity conferring
   increased susceptibility to specific pathogens. Examples include the
   discovery of the molecular genetic basis of predisposition to
   mycobacterial diseases (mutations of the IL-12-IFN-g-STAT1 circuit),
   invasive pneumococcal disease (mutations of the TIR-IRAK4-MyD88-NF-kB
   pathway), herpes simplex encephalitis (mutations of the
   TLR3-UNC93B1-IFN-a/b pathway) and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis
   (mutations of the IL-17 circuit). In parallel, Dr. Abel's team showed
   that several common infections, such as schistosomiasis and leprosy,
   reflect the inheritance of major susceptibility genes, as defined by
   segregation and/or linkage studies, at least in some populations.

   In this context, Dr. Casanova and his colleague Dr. Abel discovered the
   first cases of Mendelian predisposition to tuberculosis in children and
   the first major susceptibility locus for this disease in adults. This
   work strongly supports the notion of a continuous spectrum of genetic
   susceptibility to infectious diseases, ranging from Mendelian
   predisposition in children (during primary infection) to complex
   predisposition in adults (during reinfection or reactivation from
   latency). The laboratory is now focused on testing the hypothesis that
   life-threatening infectious diseases of childhood result from
   collections of rare single-gene inborn errors of immunity.

   Altogether, the discoveries revealed that many immunological circuits
   that were thought to play a broad role in host defense are largely
   redundant and essential for immunity against only one or a few specific
   infections. Dr. Casanova and Dr. Abel hope to decipher the genetic
   basis of several infectious diseases, thereby defining the function of
   host defense genes in the natural ecosystem in which human populations
   live and are subjected to natural selection.

   Revealing monogenic holes in the immune defense of otherwise healthy
   children also has profound clinical implications, offering many
   families worldwide the possibility of molecular diagnosis and genetic
   counseling as well as treatments aimed at restoring a deficient immune
   response. Children with impaired IFN-g production, for example, are
   prone to tuberculosis and benefit from IFN-g, whereas patients with
   impaired IFN-a/b production are prone to herpes simplex encephalitis
   and may benefit from IFN-a.

CAREER

   Dr. Casanova received his M.D. from the University of Paris Descartes
   in 1987. He received his Ph.D. in immunology from the University of
   Paris Pierre and Marie Curie in 1992, after being trained at the
   Pasteur Institute in Paris and the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research
   in Lausanne. Following a residency in pediatrics and a clinical
   fellowship in pediatric immunology-hematology, he was appointed a
   professor of pediatrics at the Necker Medical School in Paris. There,
   with Dr. Abel, he cofounded and codirected the Laboratory of Human
   Genetics of Infectious Diseases in 2001. He was appointed professor at
   Rockefeller in 2008 and named a Howard Hughes Medical Institute
   investigator in 2014.

   Dr. Casanova was an international research scholar with the Howard
   Hughes Medical Institute from 2005 to 2008 and was elected to the
   European Molecular Biology Organization in 2005. Dr. Casanova was the
   recipient of the Professor Lucien Dautrebande Pathophysiology
   Foundation Prize in 2004, the Richard Lounsbery Award in 2008, the E.
   Mead Johnson Award from the Society for Pediatric Research in 2010, the
   InBev Baillet-Latour Health Prize in 2011, the Ilse and Helmut Wachter
   Foundation Award and the Milstein Award in 2012, and the Robert Koch
   Prize and the Sanofi - Institut Pasteur Award in 2014.

   Dr. Casanova is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
