   Paul Cohen
   Obesity has been estimated to threaten the health of more than 500
   million people worldwide and more than one-third of the U.S.
   population, but no effective treatment exists for this condition. As a
   physician-scientist focusing on obesity and metabolic disease, Dr.
   Cohen investigates the molecular origins of metabolic dysfunction
   related to obesity with the ultimate goal of developing therapies to
   break the link between them.

   Obesity can bring with it a myriad of serious and even potentially
   fatal health problems, including cardiovascular disease, type 2
   diabetes and cancer. But these conditions and the timing of their onset
   are not universal; they develop much later for some patients than
   others, and a select few escape almost entirely. A number of reasons --
   genetics, diet, physical activity and the type of fat -- contribute to
   this variability. Dr. Cohen's work focuses on understanding the
   molecular underpinnings of obesity related diseases.

   Epidemiological studies have shown visceral adipose tissue, stored
   around the abdomen, increases the risk for illness and death.
   Meanwhile, subcutaneous adipose deposits, stored around the hips and
   buttocks, do not raise these risks and may even provide some
   protection. Evidence suggests the type of adipocytes within these two
   varieties of tissue is responsible for the dichotomy.

   In visceral fat, white adipocytes warehouse triglycerides in large
   droplets. In obesity, this tissue is marked by inflammation and an
   increased immune cell presence. However, other types of adipocytes
   appear to have neutral or even beneficial effects. Brown fat, once only
   known to occur in human infants and rodents, has recently been
   discovered in small amounts in adults. Brown adipocytes can protect
   body temperature by converting the chemical energy in the triglycerides
   they store into heat, and may also make significant contributions to
   adult metabolism. Likewise, a third type, beige adipocytes, can become
   activated when exposed to cold or certain hormones and can dissipate
   energy just like brown adipocytes. In rodents, beige adipocytes occur
   in clusters surrounded by white adipocytes in subcutaneous fat,
   suggesting the reason for the neutral to beneficial effects of that
   tissue. Beige adipocytes are present in humans as well, though their
   location and physiological role have yet to be fully defined.

   Using animal and cellular models and translational approaches in
   humans, Dr. Cohen investigates the transcriptional basis for the
   harmful and health protecting effects of fat deposits and the
   adipocytes they contain. Ultimately, he hopes to develop ways to
   engineer healthier fat by manipulating the regulation of the beneficial
   and adverse traits associated with different types of adipocytes.

   As a postdoc, Dr. Cohen identified a promising target for this
   approach, PRDM16, which binds in a complex with other proteins to
   regulate gene expression. Dr. Cohen and colleagues found PRDM16 acts as
   a molecular switch that determines some of the key functional
   differences between visceral and subcutaneous fat. It does so by
   activating beige adipocytes, prompting them to burn calories rather
   than store them. When they knocked out the PRDM16 gene in adipose
   tissue in mice, their beige adipocytes no longer functioned properly,
   and the animals developed obesity, insulin resistance and fatty liver.
   Meanwhile, their subcutaneous fat came to resemble visceral fat, both
   on molecular and morphological levels.

   Dr. Cohen is now investigating whether a lack of PRDM16 produces the
   negative health effects associated with visceral fat, or if the
   presence of some other regulatory factor is required. His current work
   also includes investigating the origins of specific obesity-related
   conditions: With mouse models developed as part of his work on
   transcriptional control, Dr. Cohen is studying the interactions between
   adipocytes and conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease
   and cancer.

   CAREER

   Dr. Cohen earned his bachelor's degree in biology at Harvard
   University, graduating magna cum laude. He earned his Ph.D. in 2003
   from Rockefeller University, where as a member of Jeffrey Friedman's
   lab he identified SCD-1, an enzyme that is a key mediator of the unique
   metabolic effects of leptin. He received his M.D. in 2004 from Weill
   Cornell Medical College, through the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D.
   Program. He did a residency in internal medicine at Columbia University
   Medical Center and went on to train in cardiology at Brigham and
   Women's Hospital where he later specialized in preventive cardiology.
   He did his postdoctoral work in Bruce Spiegelman's laboratory at the
   Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Cohen
   received the Harold M. Weintraub Graduate Student Award in 2004, the
   Eugene Braunwald Fellowship in Cardiovascular Medicine in 2010, and the
   Lerner Research Young Investigator Award in 2013. In 2015, he received
   the Irma T. Hirschl/Monique Weill-Caulier Trust Research Award.

   Dr. Cohen is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
