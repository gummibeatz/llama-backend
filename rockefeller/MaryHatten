Faculty Bio

   Mary Hatten

   Dr. Hatten is investigating the assembly of the complex cellular
   architecture of the mammalian brain during development. Exploring cell
   differentiation and migration, her research has broad significance for
   human genetic studies on brain diseases and clinical implications for
   conditions that are partially due to developmental abnormalities in the
   brain, such as autism, attention deficit disorder, and childhood
   epilepsy. Her work on cerebellar development has also provided insights
   on medulloblastoma, the most prevalent childhood metastatic brain
   tumor.

   Using the mouse cerebellar cortex as a model for central nervous system
   development, Dr. Hatten studies mechanisms of cerebellar neurogenesis
   and migration. Recent studies on the neurogenesis of cerebellar granule
   neurons have identified two novel regulators: Wnt3 and Casein kinase 1
   delta (Ck1d). Wnt3 is a key inhibitor of granule cell precursor
   proliferation via activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. In
   collaboration with Dr. Nagi Ayad, she has also shown that Ck1d, an
   anaphase-promoting complex substrate, is required for granule cell
   progenitor proliferation. Parallel studies on medulloblastoma showed
   overexpression of WNT3 or inhibition of Ck1d inhibit medulloblastoma
   formation. Thus, the granule cell provides a model for mechanisms that
   control both central nervous system (CNS) neurogenesis and
   medulloblastoma formation.

   Glial-guided neuronal migration is a key step in cortical histogenesis,
   ushering postmitotic neurons to the position where they form synapses.
   The Hatten lab pioneered the development of video imaging methods to
   view the dynamics of CNS neuronal migration along glial fibers. In live
   imaging studies, key steps included the extension of a highly
   polarized, leading process in the direction of migration, assembly of
   an interstitial adhesion junction beneath the cell soma, formation of a
   perinuclear tubulin cage to maintain posterior positioning of the
   nucleus and localization of actomyosin contractile motors ahead of the
   nucleus.

   Functional studies showed the conserved polarity protein complex mPar6
   controls the actomyosin contractility in the leading process, which
   propels the neuron along the glial guide. Current studies focus on the
   small Rho GTPase Cdc42, an upstream regulator of mPar6, and the
   polarized trafficking of neuron-glial adhesion receptors during
   migration.

   Dr. Hatten has also extensively studied the neuron-glial adhesion
   protein astrotactin (ASTN1), a receptor she discovered in 1987. The
   Astn1 gene is expressed by neurons migrating along glial fibers in both
   the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex, and genetic studies provide
   evidence that Astn1 functions in neuronal migration. The lab has also
   characterized a second member of the Astn family, Astn2, which was
   recently identified as a risk factor in autism, attention deficit
   hyperactivity disorder and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Recent
   experiments show Astn2 is abundant in cerebellar granule neurons during
   glial-guided migration and in cerebellar Purkinje neurons in the adult.
   ASTN2 is also expressed in the adult hippocampus and cerebral cortex.
   Whereas ASTN2 regulates the trafficking of ASTN1 during neuronal
   migration early in development, in the adult brain it also regulates
   the trafficking of synaptic proteins. Current studies focus on the role
   of ASTN2 in synaptic plasticity.

   To study neurons with ASTN2 lesions from autism patients, she develops
   protocols to differentiate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into
   cerebellar neurons. These methods derive, in part, from studies on
   mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells showing that mES-derived granule cells
   would integrate into the developing mouse cerebellum, extend axons,
   migrate to the correct layer and form synaptic connections with
   afferent mossy fibers. To further characterize iPSC-derived neurons,
   she uses bacTRAP technology developed by the Heintz lab.

CAREER

   Dr. Hatten received a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Hollins
   College in 1971. She received her Ph.D. in biochemical sciences from
   Princeton University in 1975 and did her postdoctoral research in
   neuroscience at Harvard Medical School. She was on the New York
   University School of Medicine faculty from 1978 to 1987 and then at the
   College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University. She came to
   Rockefeller in 1992 and was named the Frederick P. Rose Professor in
   2000. In 2005, Dr. Hatten was Wiersma Visiting Professor of
   Neuroscience at the California Institute of Technology.

   Dr. Hatten received the Weil Award from the American Association of
   Neuropathologists in 1996. In 1991 she received the McKnight Endowment
   Fund for Neuroscience Investigator Award, the Javits Neuroscience
   Investigator Award and a Faculty Award for Women Scientists and
   Engineers from the National Science Foundation. She also received the
   Pew Neuroscience Award in 1988 and the Irma T. Hirschl Fund Career
   Scientist Award in 1980. Dr. Hatten is a fellow of the American
   Association for the Advancement of Science.

   Dr. Hatten is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
