   Fernando Nottebohm

   Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder of late onset. The
   Nottebohm laboratory has developed transgenic zebra finches that
   express the human mutant gene that causes the disorder and uses song
   learning and song production to track the modus operandi of the mutant
   gene. Dr. Nottebohm is also interested in how our view of ourselves and
   of the universe came to be.

   The Nottebohm laboratory has worked on the neurobiology of vocal
   learning in songbirds, work that uncovered the circuits for the
   acquisition and production of learned vocalizations and revealed that
   some of the song nuclei were sexually dimorphic and changed volume
   seasonally. A closer inspection of this phenomenon in a particular song
   nucleus led to the discovery that new neurons were continually produced
   in adulthood and that survival of the new neurons was affected by use
   and disuse. These neurons were born by division of radial glia in the
   ventricular zone of the lateral ventricle and from there migrated
   through the adult telencephalon to their final destination. In
   canaries, which learn new songs every year, the production of new
   neurons was accompanied by the replacement of older neurons of the same
   kind that had died. This replacement peaked at times of song change. In
   zebra finches, which learn their song only once, the new neurons born
   in adulthood did not replace others, but led to a net gain in their
   numbers; as this happened, song became more stereotyped and resistant
   to deafening. These findings challenged existing ideas that held that
   all the plasticity required for learning was vested in the number and
   status of synapses. In parts of the songbird forebrain not related to
   song, neurons are replaced in adulthood at times of peak novel
   stimulation.

   Ongoing work in the Nottebohm laboratory, led by senior research
   associate Wan-Chun Liu, is focused on understanding neurodegenerative
   disorders. In an effort to understand how Huntington's disease
   develops, Dr. Nottebohm and Dr. Liu have inserted into the early embryo
   of zebra finches the mutant human Huntingtin gene that is responsible
   for Huntington's disease. The mutant human gene has 145 CAG repeats and
   is passed down from one generation to the next. These transgenic birds
   show difficulty copying the song of an adult model, and once they reach
   adulthood the song starts to deteriorate. The researchers are
   interested in understanding whether the difficulties with song learning
   and the time of onset and extent of song deterioration are related to
   the number of CAG repeats and, if so, in what manner. Only four CAG
   repeats normally occur in zebra finches.

   Dr. Nottebohm has also turned his attention to a project in which he
   has had a long-standing interest: the history of key events in human
   evolution and in the evolution of human culture. He is interested in
   describing this progression as a biological phenomenon, using the
   standards of evidence and disbelief normally
   applied to science.

CAREER

   Born in Buenos Aires, Dr. Nottebohm earned his undergraduate degree in
   1962 and his Ph.D. in 1966 at the University of California, Berkeley.
   He spent a year at the University of Cambridge as part of his doctoral
   training before joining Rockefeller in 1967 as assistant professor. He
   became associate professor in 1971 and professor in 1976.

   Dr. Nottebohm's many awards and honors include The Mortimer D. Sackler,
   M.D. Prize for Distinguished Achievement in Developmental Psychobiology
   in 2011, the 2006 Benjamin Franklin Medal in Life Science, the 2005
   Karl Spencer Lashley Award of the American Philosophical Society, the
   2004 Lewis S. Rosenstiel Award for Distinguished Work in Basic Medical
   Science, the 1999 Ipsen Foundation Prize in Neuronal Plasticity, the
   1997 McKnight Foundation Senior Investigator Award in neuroscience and
   the Charles A. Dana Award for Pioneering Achievement in Health Sciences
   in 1992. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1988.

   Dr. Nottebohm is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
