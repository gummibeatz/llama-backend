Faculty Bio

   Stanislas Leibler

   Even the simplest of organisms, such as bacteria, are capable of
   processing information in a highly sophisticated manner, adapting to
   varying environments and evolving new functions. Dr. Leibler is
   interested in the quantitative description of microbial systems, both
   on cellular and population levels.

   In recent years, the field of molecular biology has moved away from the
   study of individual components and toward the study of how they
   interact, creating a "systemic" approach that seeks an appropriate and
   quantitative description of cells and organisms. Dr. Leibler's
   laboratory is developing both the theoretical and experimental methods
   necessary for conducting studies on the collective behavior of
   biomolecules, cells and organisms. By selecting a number of basic
   questions on how simple genetic and biochemical networks function in
   bacteria, his lab is beginning to understand how individual components
   can give rise to complex, collective phenomena.

   Recent research topics in the laboratory include quantitative studies
   of interacting microorganisms. In particular, the question of the
   survival of microbial populations in varying environments is being
   addressed both experimentally and theoretically. Dr. Leibler and his
   collaborators are developing new experimental techniques that will
   facilitate quantitative analysis of long-time population dynamics in
   microbial populations. Long-term dynamics of closed microbial
   ecosystems are being analyzed by statistical methods. Theoretical
   approaches are also applied to other problems, such as protein
   assemblies or evolution of protein families.

CAREER

   Dr. Leibler did his undergraduate studies in physics at the University
   of Warsaw. He received three degrees from the University of Paris: an
   M.S. in theoretical physics in 1979, a Ph.D. in theoretical physics in
   1981 and a second Ph.D. in physics in 1984. He spent a year at the
   École Normale Supérieure and became a tenured research fellow at the
   Centre d'Études de Saclay in 1984, staying until 1992. Dr. Leibler was
   also a visiting research associate at Cornell University from 1985 to
   1987 and a visiting professor at the École Supérieure de Physique et
   Chimie Industrielles from 1989 to 1991. Dr. Leibler moved to Princeton
   University in 1992 as a professor in the department of physics,
   becoming a professor in the department of molecular biology in 1993. He
   spent the year from 1997 to 1998 as a visiting scientist at the
   European Molecular Biological Laboratory in Heidelberg, Germany.

   During his last year at Princeton, from 2000 to 2001, Dr. Leibler was a
   Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. He moved to Rockefeller
   in 2001 and was a Tri-Institutional professor at Weill Cornell Medical
   College and the Sloan-Kettering Institute from 2003 to 2010. Since
   April 2009, Dr. Leibler has been sharing his time between Rockefeller
   and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where he is a
   professor at the School of Natural Sciences

   Dr. Leibler is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program, the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program and
   the Tri-Institutional Ph.D. Program in Chemical Biology.
