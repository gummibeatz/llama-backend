Faculty Bio

   Leslie Vosshall

   The overall goal of work in the Vosshall laboratory is to understand
   how complex behaviors are modulated by external chemosensory cues and
   internal physiological states. Working with Drosophila melanogaster
   flies, mosquitoes and human subjects, Dr. Vosshall's research has
   yielded new knowledge about how odor stimuli are processed and
   perceived.

   Dr. Vosshall's lab takes a multidisciplinary approach spanning cell
   biology, genetics, neurobiology and behavior. The early focus of the
   lab has been to study how the brain interprets olfactory signals in the
   environment that signal food, danger or potential mating partners. The
   group has been studying these problems in three model organisms: the
   fly, the mosquito and the human. The majority of the early work in the
   laboratory was carried out in the genetically tractable vinegar fly,
   Drosophila melanogaster, which displays a rich repertoire of
   chemosensory behaviors despite having a nervous system with only
   100,000 neurons. In this animal, the Vosshall lab studied the
   functional neuroanatomy of the olfactory system, how this system
   perceives sex pheromones and the structure and function of the insect
   odorant receptors.

   The Vosshall lab identified the genes that mediate odor and carbon
   dioxide perception in insects. One member of the odorant gene family,
   Orco, is of particular interest to the Vosshall lab, as it is unique in
   being expressed in nearly all olfactory neurons and is highly conserved
   across insect evolution. Dr. Vosshall's lab has shown that Orco
   functions as a coreceptor, working in tandem with odorant receptors in
   the dendrites of olfactory neurons, and has pinpointed this protein as
   a potential target for chemical inhibitors, which may help fight
   mosquito-transmitted infectious diseases.

   The group has recently expanded its research focus to establish a
   mosquito genetics research program to understand host-seeking and
   blood-feeding behavior in the mosquito. The Vosshall lab studies the
   malaria mosquito (Anopheles gambiae) and the yellow fever mosquito
   (Aedes aegypti), which have both evolved an intense attraction to human
   body odor and carbon dioxide -- the gas humans exhale -- and thus serve
   as deadly vectors of infectious disease. Olfactory cues guide
   mosquitoes toward humans, from which the mosquitoes derive the blood
   they need to complete ovarian development. To shed new light on
   mosquito olfaction and host-seeking behavior, the Vosshall lab has
   developed genome editing techniques for targeted mutagenesis in A.
   aegypti using zinc-finger nucleases, TALENs and the CRISPR/Cas9 system.
   The establishment of loss-of-function genetics in mosquitoes has opened
   up new paths of investigation in vector biology, including the
   neurobiology of host seeking.

   Another broad area of interest is olfactory perception in humans. The
   Rockefeller University Smell Study, directed by research associate
   Andreas Keller, has been carrying out large-scale research on human
   subjects to combine olfactory psychophysics with genetic analysis in
   order to understand the mechanisms of olfactory perception in humans.
   Recent work has challenged the assumption that humans have a
   comparatively poor sense of smell compared to animals and led to the
   finding that the human nose has the power to discriminate between a
   very large number of olfactory stimuli. Ongoing work aims to link
   variation in olfactory perception to genetic polymorphisms, to probe
   the basic perceptual logic of human smell and to develop clinical
   interventions for patients suffering from olfactory dysfunction.

CAREER

   Dr. Vosshall received her undergraduate degree in biochemistry from
   Columbia University in 1987 and her Ph.D. from The Rockefeller
   University in 1993. She conducted her postdoctoral training with
   Richard Axel at Columbia from 1993 to 2000, when she returned to
   Rockefeller as assistant professor. She was promoted to associate
   professor in 2006 and was made the Robin Chemers Neustein Professor in
   2010. She was appointed a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator
   in 2008.

   Dr. Vosshall received a Gill Young Investigator Award in 2011, a
   Dart/NYU biotech award in 2010, a Lawrence C. Katz Prize from Duke
   University in 2009 and a Blavatnik Award for Young Scientists in 2007.
   In 2005 she received the New York City Mayor's Award for Excellence in
   Science and Technology and the Irma T. Hirschl/Monique Weill-Caulier
   Trusts Research Award. In 2002 she received the Presidential Early
   Career Award for Scientists and Engineers and was named a John Merck
   Fund Scholar. She was named an Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation
   Young Investigator in 2001, when she also received a National Science
   Foundation Faculty Early Career Development Award and a McKnight
   Scholar Award in Neuroscience.

   Dr. Vosshall is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
