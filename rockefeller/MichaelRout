   Michael Rout

   As the sole points of passage between the nucleus and the cytoplasm for
   large biological molecules, nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) form gateways
   that regulate the import and export of cargo to the nucleus. Many
   oncogenic and developmental defects are directly associated with
   alterations in nucleocytoplasmic transport, and Dr. Rout is interested
   in understanding how NPCs mediate transport and in gaining a better
   understanding of the nature of these defects.

   Using a variety of techniques and yeast as a model system, Dr. Rout and
   his colleagues are studying the structure of NPCs and relating the
   structure to sites of interactions and reactions with soluble nuclear
   transport factors. They hope to gain a better understanding of the part
   NPCs play in nuclear regulation and maintenance.

   A full understanding of how NPCs mediate transport requires a
   comprehensive inventory of the molecular components of NPCs, a
   knowledge of how each component contributes to the overall structure of
   these large molecular translocation machines and information on the
   interactions their proteins make with components of the soluble phase.
   Dr. Rout and his colleagues have catalogued the components of the yeast
   NPC and determined that it is composed of a surprisingly small number
   of proteins whose size and overall high degree of symmetry account for
   the NPC's large mass. They have also determined the position, shape,
   fold type and stoichiometry of each nuclear protein, or "nup," and have
   systematically isolated nup subcomplexes and analyzed their composition
   by mass spectrometry in order to determine the network of interactions
   they make. Together, this wealth of information represents thousands of
   spatial restraints, which have been computationally integrated into a
   three-dimensional map of the NPC's architecture sufficient to resolve
   the molecular organization of the entire NPC. This mapping has exposed
   similarities between structures in coated vesicles and those in the
   NPC, supporting a hypothesis for their common evolutionary origin in a
   progenitor protocoatomer. Moreover, the map reveals an extensive
   underlying modularity in the architecture of the NPC, suggesting that
   repeated duplication events led to the evolution of the NPC's final
   architecture. Work continues to characterize the architecture of the
   NPC.

   The lab is studying members of the mobile phase in a similar fashion,
   focusing on the kinetic behavior of nup-transport factor and transport
   factor-cargo interactions using a variety of in vitro and in vivo
   approaches. Already, these results have suggested a mechanism for
   nuclear transport. The lab's eventual aim is to integrate
   ultrastructural and biochemical studies to understand the molecular
   basis of the translocation of different transport factors across the
   NPC. Dr. Rout aims to reconstitute key reactions of these processes in
   vitro, study the high-resolution structures mediating the transport
   processes and test possible mechanistic models in vivo to understand
   the complete sequence of events during a transport cycle.

   With support from the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Rout has
   formed the National Center for Dynamic Interactome Research
   (www.ncdir.org), where several laboratories at Rockefeller and at other
   institutions are collaborating to develop the methodology required to
   obtain a comprehensive map of protein interactions within any organism
   and to study their dynamic behaviors. This will allow researchers to
   explore the utility of the technology for functional elucidation of
   complex biological processes, with an initial focus on those processes
   related to cell cycle control, transcription, oncogenesis and viral
   infection.

CAREER

   Dr. Rout received his Ph.D. in 1990 from the Medical Research Council
   Laboratory of Molecular Biology at the University of Cambridge, working
   with J.V. Kilmartin. He joined Rockefeller in 1990 as a postdoctoral
   fellow in Günter Blobel's laboratory and was appointed assistant
   professor and head of laboratory in 1997. He was promoted to associate
   professor in 2002 and professor in 2008. He is the recipient of
   numerous awards, including the 2001 Presidential Early Career Award for
   Scientists and Engineers.
