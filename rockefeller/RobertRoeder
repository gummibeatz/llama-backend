Faculty Bio

   Robert Roeder

   One of the biggest questions in biology is how cells control or
   regulate transcription, the process by which genes are copied into RNA
   for translation into proteins, and how this process breaks down in
   certain diseases such as cancer. The answer ultimately may lead to new
   drugs that selectively switch genes on or off for the treatment of not
   only cancer but also heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, AIDS and any
   other medical condition in which normal gene activity is disrupted.

   Dr. Roeder's broad objectives are to understand the specific regulatory
   events that control these processes, as well as more fundamental
   aspects of transcription activation and repression mechanisms. To this
   end, his specific objectives are to determine the nature and mechanism
   of action of both the general transcription machinery that is commonly
   used by all genes and the gene- and cell typespecific factors that
   directly regulate target genes in response to various growth,
   developmental and stress stimuli.

   The Roeder lab's multipronged experimental strategy begins with the use
   of a biochemical tool called the cell-free system, pioneered by Dr.
   Roeder, that allows researchers to recreate the essence of
   transcription in a test tube with cloned genes and cellular extracts.
   They then biochemically dissect these systems, purify and clone the
   individual factors and study the structure, function and regulation of
   these factors by a combination of biochemical and genetic (i.e.,
   transgenic, knockout and knockin mice) analyses.

   The actual transcription of protein-coding genes is mediated directly
   by RNA polymerase II and a number of common initiation factors (TFIID,
   TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF and TFIIH) that form functional
   preinitiation complexes on promoters via an ordered assembly pathway
   that begins with recognition of common core promoter elements (notably
   the TATA box and initiator elements) by the multisubunit TFIID.

   These factors -- comprising the general transcription machinery --
   represent the ultimate targets of the various gene-specific factors.
   However, despite the specificity intrinsic to the gene-specific
   transcriptional regulatory proteins, the complexity of the general
   transcription machinery (about 44 distinct polypeptides) and documented
   physical interactions among these components, other "cofactors" have
   been found essential for functional communication between the
   gene-specific activators/repressors and the general transcription
   machinery on specific target genes.

   Dr. Roeder's work is now heavily focused on these cofactors (both
   coactivators and corepressors), many of which are structurally complex.
   They include cofactors (e.g., multisubunit histone acetyltransferase,
   methyltransferase and ubiquitination complexes) that alter the
   structure of the natural chromatin template, cofactors (e.g., the
   30-subunit Mediator complex and negative regulators NC-2 and Gdown-1)
   that act directly on the general transcription machinery and a variety
   of gene- and/or activator-specific factors (e.g., the B cell-specific
   OCA-B and the inducible PGC-1 implicated in energy metabolism). Current
   activities focus on transcriptional activators (and corresponding
   genetic regulatory pathways) important for homeostasis (nuclear
   receptors such as thyroid hormone receptor, estrogen receptor,
   estrogen-related receptor and peroxisome proliferation-activated
   receptor); lymphoid/myeloid cell differentiation and malignancy
   (OCT-1/2, OCA-B and NF-kB; E2A and leukemogenic fusion proteins E2A-HLA
   and E2A-Pbx1; AML and the leukemogenic AML-ETO fusion protein; and
   mixed lineage leukemia factor MLL-1 and its leukemogenic fusion
   partners); and DNA damage responses (tumor suppressor p53 and related
   family members).

   Apart from detailing the mechanisms by which specific target genes are
   activated by individual transcriptional activators and essential
   cofactors, the Roeder laboratory also is interested in determining
   differential usage of cofactors by different activators or by the same
   activator in different cell types or on different target genes and,
   especially, how variations in cofactors can dictate cell fate (e.g.,
   growth arrest versus apoptosis in p53-dependent DNA damage responses).

CAREER

   Dr. Roeder received his Ph.D. in biochemistry in 1969 from the
   University of Washington, Seattle, where he worked with William Rutter.
   He did postdoctoral work with Donald D. Brown at the Carnegie
   Institution of Washington from 1969 to 1971. He was a member of the
   faculty at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis
   from 1971 until 1982, when he joined Rockefeller. In 1985 he was named
   Arnold and Mabel Beckman Professor. Dr. Roeder received the 2010 Salk
   Institute Medal for Research Excellence and the 2003 Albert Lasker
   Basic Medical Research Award. He shared the 2002 ASBMB-Merck Award, the
   2000 Gairdner Foundation International Award, the 1999 Louisa Gross
   Horwitz Prize and the 1999 General Motors Cancer Research Foundation's
   Alfred P. Sloan Prize. He is a member of the National Academy of
   Sciences.

   Dr. Roeder is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
