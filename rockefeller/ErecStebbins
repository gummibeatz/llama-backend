   C. Erec Stebbins

   Bacterial pathogens that have coevolved with their hosts display
   remarkably sophisticated adaptations, often engaging their hosts in
   intricate biochemical cross talk. Using techniques from biochemistry,
   microbial cell biology and x-ray crystallography, Dr. Stebbins's
   laboratory examines the targeting of host machineries by these
   bacterial virulence factors and studies their translocation apparatus,
   with the eventual goal of using this knowledge to design novel
   antibiotics.

   The large repertoire of virulence factors from pathogens such as
   Yersinia species (plague), Shigella species (bacterial dysentery),
   Escherichia coli (enterohaemorrhagic diarrhea), Pseudomonas aeruginosa
   (opportunistic pneumonia) and Salmonella enterica (gastroenteritis and
   typhoid fever) includes protein tyrosine phosphatases, protein kinases,
   lipid phosphatases and other effectors. Structural work with the
   molecules that make up these virulence factors promises to illuminate
   many aspects of the host-pathogen interaction and to provide new tools
   for understanding a variety of basic eukaryotic cellular processes.

   Dr. Stebbins's laboratory is examining effector biochemical and
   pathogenic activity via structural biology and structure-based
   mutagenesis in combination with in vitro and in vivo assays. Their
   ultimate goal is to synthesize a mechanistic understanding of the
   pathogen's host-cell invasion process. Since the process is a central
   event in several pathogenic organisms and an example of subtle and
   sophisticated biochemical cross talk between host and pathogen, it
   represents an ideal field of study for infectious disease and
   structural biology.

   Another effort in the lab is the structural characterization of the
   type III secretion apparatus used by many bacteria. Type III secretion
   systems translocate bacterial proteins directly into the host-cell
   cytosol, are composed of more than 20 proteins and are closely related
   to the flagellar assembly apparatus. Although the basic components of
   these incredibly complex systems have been identified, the actual
   mechanisms of protein secretion are poorly understood.

   A subset of the type III secretion components forms a supramolecular
   structure known as the needle complex that spans the bacterial
   envelope. This "organic nanosyringe" is thought to serve as a conduit
   or channel for the passage of secreted proteins through the bacterial
   envelope on their route to the host-cell cytosol. Because the secretion
   of bacterial effectors is central to virulence in these organisms,
   studying their export apparatus is key to understanding type III
   secretion systems.

   Bacteria are constantly evolving and exchanging mechanisms to resist
   antibiotics, so there is a great need for novel pharmacological
   interventions in bacterial infection. Dr. Stebbins's lab is interested
   in using information gleaned from experiments to design a novel class
   of antimicrobial agents that specifically target bacterial virulence
   mechanisms.

   Dr. Stebbins has solved the structures of numerous medically relevant
   proteins, including the cancer-related Von Hippel-Lindau tumor
   suppressor, the oncogenic chaperone Hsp90 and a growing number of
   bacterial toxins. His research led to the first structural renderings
   of cytolethal distending toxin (a widespread genotoxin found in a
   number of disease-causing bacteria), AvrPtoB (a bacterial mimic of host
   E3 ubiquitin ligases) and YpkA (a critical virulence factor from the
   plague pathogen) and the first structural information of the virulence
   factor CagA of Helicobacter pylori. The structures he has identified
   can be used to determine how the pathogenic molecules might be most
   vulnerable to deactivation and are therefore effective targets for drug
   therapy.

CAREER

   Dr. Stebbins received his bachelor's degree in physics from Oberlin
   College in 1992. After working for a year as a graduate fellow in the
   physics department at Stony Brook University and another year as a
   research assistant in Seth A. Darst's Laboratory of Molecular
   Biophysics at Rockefeller, he continued his graduate research in
   molecular biophysics. He received his Ph.D. in biochemistry and
   structural biology in 1999 from Cornell University's Weill Graduate
   School of Medical Sciences. Dr. Stebbins did his postdoctoral work in
   microbial pathogenesis at the Yale University School of Medicine and
   then moved to Rockefeller in 2001 when he was appointed assistant
   professor and head of the Laboratory of Structural Microbiology. He was
   named associate professor in 2006.

   Dr. Stebbins received the American Society for Microbiology's ICAAC
   Young Investigator Award in 2004 and the Molecular Structure
   Corporation's Future Investigator Award in 2000. He was awarded the
   Julian R. Rachele Prize from Cornell's Weill Graduate School of Medical
   Sciences in 1999. He is the recipient of several governmental and
   private awards, including the EUREKA award from the National Institutes
   of Health to explore potential therapeutic uses for the bacterial
   nanosyringe.

   Dr. Stebbins is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program, the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program and
   the Tri-Institutional Ph.D. Program in Chemical Biology.
