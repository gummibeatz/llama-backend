   Sanford Simon

   The Simon lab studies individual events as a way of gaining insight
   into biological systems. Using primarily biophysical tools with a heavy
   emphasis on imaging, lab members examine the movement of single
   proteins in the cell, single proteins and toxins as they cross
   membranes, assembly of single viruses, transport of single vesicles,
   single mitochondria and single cells during apoptosis, and metastasis
   of single tumor cells through the body.

   Why imaging? Dr. Simon uses imaging techniques to observe and clarify
   dynamics and interactions in living systems. Imaging enables his group
   to study molecules in isolation, in the living cell or in the living
   animal and, often, to detect alternations of single molecules that
   produce pathological changes in the whole animal by allowing studies in
   both spatial scales. Imaging single molecules or cells provides the
   means to report not only the average behavior of populations, but also
   the diversity of their individual behaviors.

   Why study individuals? Dr. Simon also focuses on individual entities
   and events. The study of populations (whether populations of molecules,
   cells or people) has provided important insights into many biological
   processes. However, sometimes valuable information is lost when one
   examines the average of a population -- information that is retained
   when one studies individuals. For example, if a cellular machine exists
   in two discrete states, the macroscopic measure will give the average
   of the two states. But such a measure has several shortcomings,
   according to Dr. Simon. First, the averaged (macroscopic) measure may
   reflect an activity state that does not exist at the level of the
   individual. Second, often in biology the active state is transient.
   Macroscopic measurements report the average and therefore miss out on
   these transients; short-lived but functionally significant states can
   be detected and studied by examining individuals. Third, macroscopic
   measurements can make it difficult to put the different steps in a
   proper temporal order. On a macroscopic level this can be addressed by
   synchronizing a system. However, as it progresses through subsequent
   steps, the relative temporal ordering is lost. At the single-molecule
   level the temporal order is unambiguous. Fourth, at a macroscopic level
   it is often impossible to resolve between two microscopic mechanisms
   that can be resolved by studying single molecules.

   The ability to follow single events has allowed Dr. Simon and his lab
   members to follow individual vesicles as they dock and fuse to the
   membrane, individual endosomes as they form, single proteins as they
   translocate across the endoplasmic reticulum and single cells as they
   metastasize in the lung. They have also succeeded in imaging the birth
   of individual HIV particles and a variety of events involved with
   apoptosis. The sensitivity afforded by these imaging studies has
   allowed them to critically test, and in some cases eliminate, models
   that had been proposed for biological mechanisms. The ability to test
   -- and at times negate -- models has driven lab members to formulate
   new models: They were the first to propose localized calcium transients
   in cells and the first to suggest that protein movement in the cell may
   be driven by a Brownian ratchet.

   A key area of research in the Simon lab is in developing new
   technologies that can improve the spatial or temporal resolution of
   images obtained through microscopes and other modalities. Dr. Simon and
   his colleagues are working to improve the sensitivity of the imaging
   systems they use so that molecules can be followed for longer periods
   of time, and to develop new reporters that can follow biological
   processes and act as actuators for these processes.

CAREER

   Dr. Simon graduated with a bachelor's degree in neurobiology from
   Princeton University in 1977. He received his Ph.D. in physiology and
   biophysics in 1984 from New York University Medical Center, where he
   studied with Rodolfo LlinaÅLs. He came to Rockefeller as a postdoc in
   Günter Blobel's lab and was promoted to research associate in 1986. He
   was named assistant professor in 1989, head of the Laboratory of
   Cellular Biophysics in 1992, associate professor in 1994 and professor
   in 2000. Dr. Simon was a 2004 recipient of the John and Samuel Bard
   Award in Medicine and Science.
