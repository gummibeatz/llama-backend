   Hermann Steller

   Cell death plays an important role in sculpting a developing organism
   and eliminating unwanted and potentially dangerous cells throughout
   life. All animal cells have a genetic program that, when activated,
   leads to a distinct form of cell death called apoptosis. Dr. Steller's
   research focuses on how this death program is regulated by different
   signaling pathways and how abnormal regulation of apoptosis contributes
   to a variety of human diseases, including cancer.

   Because apoptosis is central to both development and tissue homeostasis
   and is intimately associated with a variety of human diseases including
   cancer, autoimmunity, AIDS, neurodegenerative disorders and liver
   diseases, cell death proteins are promising drug targets. Using both
   Drosophila melanogaster and mice as model organisms, Dr. Steller's
   laboratory investigates the molecular mechanisms that govern the
   decision between cell death and survival.

   Apoptosis has been conserved in evolution from worms to insects to
   humans. Dr. Steller's lab discovered and characterized a family of
   proteins that act as integrators of many different signaling pathways
   to ensure that the death program is activated in cells that are doomed
   to die. Reaper, Hid and Grim activate apoptosis by binding to and
   inactivating inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins, which in turn
   directly inhibit caspases, the key executioners of apoptosis. In this
   way, Reaper-family proteins remove powerful "brakes" on death. A
   conserved IAP-binding motif that was originally discovered in these
   proteins has provided the basis for developing a novel class of cancer
   therapeutics that are currently being evaluated in clinical trials.

   Many organs and tissues can repair wounds and regenerate cells that
   have been lost upon injury. Dr. Steller discovered that cells
   undergoing apoptosis in response to stress or injury (such as
   radiation) can stimulate their own replacement by secreting mitogens to
   induce proliferation of adjacent progenitor cells. These secreted
   mitogens include Wingless (Wnt) and BMP/TGF-b-family proteins. These
   pathways have been highly conserved in evolution, and similar phenomena
   have been recently observed in mammals. These findings have profound
   implications for cancer therapy, stem cell biology and regenerative
   medicine.

   The cell death machinery can also serve nonlethal functions for
   cellular remodeling in Drosophila and mammals. Dr. Steller's work
   initially revealed the importance of this process for the generation of
   mature sperm, but subsequently similar mechanisms were shown to operate
   during development of the nervous system. Dr. Steller defined the role
   of enzymes that control protein degradation in this system, and he
   recently discovered a new mechanism for regulating the activity of
   proteasomes, the proteolytic complex responsible for the degradation of
   most intracellular proteins. Collectively, this work reveals that the
   two major proteolytic systems, caspases and proteasomes, are
   coordinated to achieve "controlled demolition" of unwanted cellular
   structures. These findings are relevant for a better understanding and
   treatment of human diseases, including muscle-wasting diseases and
   cancer.

   The Steller lab also studies cells that are highly resistant to cell
   death, including terminally differentiated neurons. Using Drosophila
   photoreceptor neurons as a model system, Dr. Steller is researching the
   survival mechanisms by which these cells resist apoptosis; one involves
   the unfolded protein response, which has been linked to diabetes,
   cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. However, Dr. Steller's lab has
   shown that in a Drosophila model of autosomal dominant retinitis
   pigmentosa, a disease that causes blindness, the unfolded protein
   response is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum organelle, not the
   cytoplasm, and protects cells from apoptosis. This research has added
   another level of complexity to the role of unfolded proteins in cell
   death and disease.

   While Dr. Steller uses Drosophila as the primary model to discover cell
   death genes and order them into pathways, his lab is also testing
   whether concepts originally developed in Drosophila can be applied to
   mammalian systems and translated to the clinic. For this purpose, Dr.
   Steller and his colleagues have generated mouse strains with mutations
   in select cell death genes. This work has provided the first direct
   evidence for a role of mammalian IAP antagonists in caspase regulation
   and tumor suppression in vivo. Finally, Dr. Steller's laboratory is
   developing small-molecule compounds that are designed to selectively
   activate apoptosis in cancer cells for highly specific and efficient
   tumor cell killing.

CAREER

   Born in Germany, Dr. Steller received his undergraduate degree in
   microbiology and molecular genetics from the University of Frankfurt in
   1981. At the European Molecular Biology Laboratory and the University
   of Heidelberg, he earned his Ph.D. in molecular biology in 1984. After
   a postdoc in molecular neurobiology at the University of California,
   Berkeley, Dr. Steller became assistant professor of neurobiology at the
   Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1987. He became associate
   professor in 1993, received tenure in 1994 and became professor in
   1996. Dr. Steller came to Rockefeller in 2000.

   In 2001 Dr. Steller received the Lady Davis Award from the Faculty of
   Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. He was named a Pew
   Scholar by the Pew Charitable Trusts in 1989 and a Searle Scholar by
   the Chicago Community Trust in 1988.

   Dr. Steller is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
