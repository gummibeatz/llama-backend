   Eric Siggia

   As large amounts of genetic data, such as genome sequences, have been
   generated, the field of bioinformatics has become essential for
   processing and analyzing biological information. Dr. Siggia's
   laboratory uses the bioinformatics approach to study gene control in
   bacteria, yeast and flies, inventing probability-based models to
   discern the regulatory patterns involved in gene expression and other
   biological processes.

   Genetics and genome sequencing have supplied an extensive parts list
   for how to create an embryo, yet it is still impossible to construct a
   precise description of the process from genome scale data. Existing
   models of signaling pathways have too many parameters to fit
   experimentally and ignore the complexities of cell biology. Dr.
   Siggia's group works to develop mathematical models that apply broadly
   to biological problems.

   Dr. Siggia's group has recently developed mathematical descriptions for
   embryonic patterning, which encapsulate how a field of cells can react
   to an external signal and coordinate among themselves to choose between
   three discrete fates. The resulting mathematics is geometric and
   naturally meshes with the phenomenological concepts from the
   pre-molecular era of embryology.

   The Siggia lab has developed a phenotypic model for vulva patterning in
   C. elegans, which requires a parameter for each new allele but then can
   predict the matrix of crosses between all pairs of alleles. Ongoing
   experiments with Rockefeller's Shai Shaham aim to test predictions of
   this theory.

   Vertebrate signaling pathways are another area where pathway dynamics
   in single cells has lagged behind the genetic and biochemical findings.
   In collaboration with Rockefeller's Ali Brivanlou, Dr. Siggia's group
   has found that the TGF-b pathway is adaptive: in response to a step
   increase in ligand, the transcriptional response of the pathway turns
   off. This is not due to the known negative feedbacks that operate at
   the receptor level since the transcriptional effectors that are
   phosphorylated by the receptors remain on. By adapting a microfluidic
   cell, developed at Stanford University, to examine the response of
   cells to a variety of temporal stimuli, Dr. Siggia and his
   collaborators have noted an important corollary of adaption in the
   embryo: that positional information can be conveyed by the rate of
   ligand changes, not merely its level.

   To take a step closer to the embryo, the Siggia lab has begun
   investigating early differentiation in human embryonic stem cells
   (hESCs). All three germ layers can be induced by the two classes of
   TGF-b ligands, and the group has focused on the space-time development
   of the earliest fates. Because cell communication via secondary signals
   is an essential part of morphogenesis, stem cell differentiation
   provides a quantitative assay for this process.

   Geometric descriptions of biodynamics are not always evident by
   inspection. With colleagues at McGill University, Dr. Siggia has
   developed computational evolutionary methods to discover them. These
   have led to proposals for how circadian oscillators can both have a
   temperature-independent period and the ability to entrain and phase
   lock to a temperature oscillation. Experiments motivated by this theory
   are in progress with the Rockefeller's Michael Young. In a related
   project with Rockefeller's Fred Cross, Dr. Siggia's group has
   demonstrated phase locking of the yeast cell cycle to a periodic cyclin
   signal. Other problems elucidated by computational network evolution
   include somitogenesis, Hox patterning and the evolution of blastoderm
   patterning between fly and mosquito.

   The phosphorylation networks in cells have the potential to act as
   analogue computers. Cells, particularly in the immune system, are often
   confronted with the task of discovering changes within a temporal
   stream of noisy data. With colleagues at the Pasteur Institute, Dr.
   Siggia has recently shown that simple networks can perform close to the
   mathematical optimum for this problem.

   In the recent past Dr. Siggia has also used bioinformatic methods to
   understand transcriptional regulation in yeast and in the fly
   blastoderm and, in collaboration with Rockefeller's Alexander Tomasz,
   has studied the evolution of antibiotic resistance in samples of
   Staphylococcus aureus from a single patient undergoing therapy.

CAREER

   Dr. Siggia received his A.B. in 1971 and his Ph.D. in physics in 1972,
   both from Harvard University. He was a junior fellow at Harvard,
   assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania, and then
   professor of physics at Cornell University. He has been a visitor or
   consultant at the University of Paris in Orsay, the École Normale
   Supérieure in Paris, the Santa Barbara Institute for Theoretical
   Physics, Bell Labs and Los Alamos National Laboratory. Dr. Siggia came
   to Rockefeller in 1997. Dr. Siggia was elected to the United States
   National Academy of Sciences in 2009. He received a John Simon
   Guggenheim Fellowship in 1988 and was an Alfred P. Sloan Research
   Fellow from 1980 to 1982.

   Dr. Siggia is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
