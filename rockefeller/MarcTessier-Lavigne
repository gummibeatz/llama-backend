   Marc Tessier-Lavigne

   Dr. Tessier-Lavigne's laboratory investigates how neural circuits in
   the brain form during embryonic development. It also studies nerve cell
   responses to injury and the mechanisms underlying nerve cell death with
   the goal of developing therapies for brain injury and neurodegenerative
   disease.

   The human brain comprises several hundred billion nerve cells or
   neurons, which are connected in an intricate and precise pattern to
   form the neural circuits that underlie all brain functions, including
   perception, memory and the control of movement. These circuits form
   during embryonic development when each neuron sends out a slender
   extension, the axon, to connect to an appropriate set of target cells.
   Dr. Tessier-Lavigne's laboratory is interested in how these neuronal
   axons locate their targets and how inappropriate axon projections are
   refined or eliminated by selective axon pruning (or degeneration)
   during development. They also study how these pruning mechanisms may
   also mediate the degeneration of axons in neurodegenerative diseases
   including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases or following trauma,
   such as in stroke or spinal cord injury.

   In the embryonic brain, developing axons are tipped by a specialized
   sensory structure called the growth cone, which senses chemical
   guidance cues that instruct it to migrate in particular directions. The
   lab has discovered a number of the chemical cues operating in the
   mammalian nervous system, including small protein families known as
   netrins and slits, as well as receptors on the growth cones that detect
   many of these cues. To understand how guidance cues collaborate to
   ensure that the axons are guided unerringly, Dr. Tessier-Lavigne's lab
   is seeking to identify the full complement of cues guiding particular
   sets of axons, as well as the intracellular pathways they trigger to
   signal directed motion. As an axon progresses along its trajectory, its
   growth cone exhibits a remarkable plasticity, changing its response to
   guidance cues -- losing responsiveness to those that directed it over
   the previous leg of its trajectory and acquiring responsiveness to
   those that will guide it over the next leg. A major focus in the lab is
   on understanding the mechanisms that control this plasticity and
   switching of growth cone responses and their relation to other plastic
   changes, such as those occurring after injury and in learning and
   memory.

   In the embryo, too many axonal connections are initially formed, and
   many axons have to be selectively eliminated through a process of
   pruning or developmental degeneration. Dr. Tessier-Lavigne's lab has
   shown that several of the cues that initially guide axons are later
   responsible for triggering axon degeneration in the embryo. The lab has
   also shown that some of the mechanisms that refine neuronal circuits
   during development are reutilized in pruning that occurs as part of
   adult plasticity, and share important mechanistic similarities with the
   neurodegeneration that occurs in diseases like Alzheimer's. To test the
   relevance of these mechanisms to human diseases, Dr. Tessier-Lavigne's
   lab has also begun using stem cell technology to reprogram nonneuronal
   cells obtained from patients with neurodegenerative diseases into
   neurons. This approach offers the opportunity to characterize the
   behavior of diseased human neurons and to examine the mechanisms that
   cause these diseased neurons to degenerate. Collectively, these studies
   have the potential to provide novel therapeutic entry points for
   treating these diseases.

CAREER

   Dr. Tessier-Lavigne received undergraduate degrees from McGill
   University and Oxford University, where he was a Rhodes Scholar. He
   received a Ph.D. in neurophysiology from University College London in
   1987 and performed postdoctoral work at University College London and
   at Columbia University. From 1991 to 2003, he held faculty positions at
   the University of California, San Francisco, and at Stanford
   University, where he was the Susan B. Ford Professor in the Humanities
   and Sciences. He was also an investigator with the Howard Hughes
   Medical Institute. He joined Genentech, a leading biotechnology
   company, in 2003, where he served as executive vice president for
   research and chief scientific officer. He joined Rockefeller as
   president and professor in March 2011.

   Dr. Tessier-Lavigne is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and
   its Institute of Medicine, a fellow of The Royal Society, a fellow of
   The Royal Society of Canada, a fellow of the Academy of Medical
   Sciences (UK), a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement
   of Science and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
   He is the recipient of the Henry G. Friesen International Prize in
   Health Research, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Medal for Outstanding
   Contributions to Biomedical Research, the Ameritec Prize, the Ipsen
   Foundation Prize in Neuronal Plasticity, the Viktor Hamburger Award,
   the Wakeman Award, the Robert Dow Neuroscience Award, the Reeve-Irvine
   Research Medal, the Gill Distinguished Award in Neuroscience, the Burke
   Award and the W. Alden Spencer Award.

   Dr. Tessier-Lavigne is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller
   Graduate Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
