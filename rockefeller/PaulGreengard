   Paul Greengard

   The Greengard laboratory studies the molecular defects responsible for
   neurological and psychiatric disorders including Alzheimer's disease,
   Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and major depressive disorder, as
   well as the molecular mechanisms by which neuro- and psychoactive drugs
   produce their pharmacological actions in these disorders.

   Research from the Greengard laboratory has demonstrated that most
   neurotransmitters and neuromodulators achieve their actions and
   interactions on postsynaptic neurons through a process called "slow
   synaptic transmission." This process involves activation of highly
   complex signal transduction cascades. For the last 10 years, the group
   has applied this knowledge to the study of the molecular pathways
   behind various neurological and psychiatric disorders.

   One major area of activity in the Greengard laboratory involves a
   search for the molecular and cellular basis of major depressive
   disorder. They recently found a protein called p11 (S100A10, a member
   of the S100 family of proteins) that plays a central role in the
   regulation of mood. Constitutive removal of p11 from neurons in the
   brain causes a depressive phenotype and a loss of behavioral response
   to antidepressant agents. Deletion of p11 from one cell type in the
   nucleus accumbens causes the depressive phenotype, and deletion from
   any of three other cell types results in the loss of behavioral
   responses to antidepressants. The antidepressant action of p11 is
   mediated through binding of p11 to a chromatin-remodeling factor,
   SMARCA3. SMARCA3, in turn, through activation of various transcription
   factors, regulates gene transcription. One current project of the
   research group is to determine which of these genes is necessary for
   the therapeutic actions of various antidepressants and to determine the
   molecular mechanisms of action of these gene products.

   A second major area of interest of the laboratory is the analysis of
   the enzymatic pathways involved in the synthesis and degradation of
   amyloid-b, the prime suspect in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease.
   The enzyme g-secretase catalyzes the formation of amyloid-b, the
   substance believed to be responsible for the death of nerve cells in
   Alzheimer's disease. In addition, g-secretase catalyzes the formation
   of notch and of many other proteins vital to cell function. The group
   has recently discovered a protein, which they named g-secretase
   activating protein (GSAP), that selectively activates the catalytic
   formation of amyloid-b by g-secretase, but not of notch. As a result,
   inhibitors of GSAP selectively prevent formation of amyloid-b without
   affecting formation of notch and other vital products. Therefore, GSAP
   represents a singularly attractive target for the development of drugs
   to inhibit amyloid-b formation and thus prevent Alzheimer's disease,
   without toxic side effects. In other studies in the laboratory, two
   pathways involved in regulation of amyloid-b degradation have been
   found, and the mechanisms by which these pathways achieve their effects
   are being investigated.

   A third area of activity of the laboratory involves determining the
   molecular basis for the differences between vulnerable cells and
   non-vulnerable cells in Alzheimer's disease and in Parkinson's disease.
   This approach is based on identifying all expressed proteins in
   individual nerve cell types in the brain using bacTRAP technology,
   which was developed in collaboration with Rockefeller's Nathaniel
   Heintz. Proteins that are highly expressed in vulnerable cells are
   introduced to non-vulnerable cells to see if they cause vulnerability.
   Conversely, proteins that are highly expressed in non-vulnerable cells
   are introduced to vulnerable cells to see if they afford protection.

CAREER

   Dr. Greengard received his Ph.D. in biophysics from The Johns Hopkins
   University in 1953. Before joining Rockefeller in 1983 as Vincent Astor
   Professor and head of laboratory, he was director of biochemical
   research at the Geigy Research Laboratories and a professor of
   pharmacology and psychiatry at Yale University. Since 1995 he has also
   directed the Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Disease Research at
   Rockefeller.

   Dr. Greengard is a member of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and
   the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Among his many awards and
   honors are the Gold Medal of the Karolinska Institute, the 2000 Nobel
   Prize in Physiology or Medicine, the 1997 Charles A. Dana Award for
   Pioneering Achievements in Health and the 1991 NAS Award in the
   Neurosciences.

   Dr. Greengard is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
