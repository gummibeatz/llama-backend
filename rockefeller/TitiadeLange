   Titia de Lange

   Dr. de Lange's lab studies telomeres, protective elements at the ends
   of our chromosomes that are critical for the stability and maintenance
   of the genetic information. Deficiency in telomere function can cause
   genomic alterations in cancer, and the gradual loss of telomeres
   contributes to aging of human cells.

   Dr. de Lange's lab focuses on mammalian telomeres, which are made up of
   long arrays of double-stranded TTAGGG repeats that end in a
   single-stranded 3' overhang. These telomeric repeats wither away in a
   shortening process that is associated with cell proliferation.
   Telomerase can counteract this attrition and stabilizes telomeres by
   adding back telomeric repeats. However, telomerase is absent from most
   human somatic cells, and, as a result, cells eventually die due to
   depletion of their telomere reserve. Cancer cells, on the other hand,
   usually reactivate telomerase, thereby achieving unlimited
   proliferative potential. The goal of Dr. de Lange's research is to
   understand how telomeres protect chromosome ends, and what happens when
   telomere function is lost during the early stages of tumorigenesis
   before telomerase is activated.

   The de Lange lab identified a six-subunit protein complex, which they
   named shelterin, that specifically binds to telomeres.
   Using Cre-mediated conditional deletion in mouse embryo fibroblasts,
   Dr. de Lange and her colleagues determined the fate of telomeres
   lacking one or more of the six shelterin subunits. This work showed
   that cells lacking shelterin perceive their natural chromosome ends as
   sites of DNA damage.

   Six distinct DNA damage response pathways are repressed by shelterin.
   Two DNA damage signaling pathways, initiated by the ATM and ATR
   checkpoint kinases, inappropriately respond to chromosome ends that
   lack shelterin. In addition, shelterin represses three DNA
   double-strand break repair pathways at telomeres, two types of
   nonhomologous end joining and homology-directed repair, which have
   detrimental outcomes at telomeres. Finally, shelterin protects
   telomeres against a sixth threat: the inappropriate resection of the
   telomeric DNA by nucleases.

   Dr. de Lange's group is now working to determine the mechanism by which
   each shelterin protein inhibits its designated pathway, and how loss of
   telomere protection contributes to genome instability in human cancer.
   A major mechanistic insight arose from the identification of the t-loop
   structure of telomeres in which the single-stranded overhang is
   inserted in the double-stranded repeat array of the telomere, thereby
   hiding the telomere end from the DNA damage response. Recent data
   showed that the TRF2 component of shelterin is required to establish
   and/or maintain this structure. Since TRF2 is responsible for the
   repression of the ATM kinase pathway and non-homologous end joining, it
   is likely that the t-loop structure is critical to prevent these two
   pathways from acting inappropriately on chromosome ends.

CAREER

   Dr. de Lange earned her Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of
   Amsterdam and the Netherlands Cancer Institute in 1985. From 1985 to
   1990 she was a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Nobel laureate
   Harold Varmus at the University of California, San Francisco, where she
   was one of the first to isolate the telomeres of human chromosomes. She
   came to Rockefeller in 1990 as assistant professor and was promoted to
   associate professor in 1994 and professor in 1997. She was named the
   Leon Hess Professor in 1999 and is an American Cancer Society Research
   Professor. She is also the director of the university's Anderson Center
   for Cancer Research.

   Among other awards, Dr. de Lange is the recipient of the 2014 Canada
   Gairdner International Award, the 2013 Breakthrough Prize in Life
   Sciences, the 2012 Dr H.P. Heineken Prize for Biochemistry and
   Biophysics, the 2012 Vanderbilt Prize in Biomedical Sciences, the 2011
   Vilcek Prize in Biomedical Science, the 2010 American Association for
   Cancer Research Clowes Memorial Award, the 2008 Massachusetts General
   Hospital Cancer Center Prize, the 2005 National Institutes of Health
   Director's Pioneer Award, and the first Paul Marks Prize for Cancer
   Research, in 2001. She is an elected member of the Royal Dutch Academy
   of Sciences, the European Molecular Biology Organization, the American
   Academy of Arts and Sciences and a foreign associate of the National
   Academy of Sciences.

   Dr. de Lange is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
