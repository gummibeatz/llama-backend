Faculty Bio

   Donald Pfaff

   Dr. Pfaff uses molecular, neuroanatomical and neurophysiological
   methods to study the cellular mechanisms by which the brain controls
   behavior. His laboratory's research has focused on steroid hormone
   effects on nerve cells as they direct natural, instinctive behaviors,
   as well as the influences of hormones and genes on generalized brain
   arousal.

   Dr. Pfaff's research has proceeded through four steps to demonstrate
   how steroid hormone effects on nerve cells can direct natural,
   instinctive behaviors. First, Dr. Pfaff is known for discovering exact
   cellular targets for steroid hormones in the brain. A system of
   hypothalamic and limbic forebrain neurons with sex hormone receptors,
   discovered in rodents, was later found to be present in species ranging
   from fish to primates. Dr. Pfaff recently found that knocking out the
   gene for the estrogen receptor in animals prevents female reproductive
   behavior and maternal behaviors. Second, Dr. Pfaff's lab has worked out
   the neural circuitry for hormone-dependent female reproductive
   behavior, the first behavior circuit elucidated for any mammal. Third,
   they have demonstrated that estrogens can turn on several genes in the
   forebrain. And fourth, Dr. Pfaff has shown that these gene products
   facilitate reproductive behavior. Together, these four advances proved
   how specific chemicals acting in specific parts of the brain determine
   individual behavioral responses.

   In experiments uniting the immune, endocrine and nervous systems with
   behavior, Dr. Pfaff and his colleagues were the first to genetically
   link the neuroimmune system to emotional behavior, showing that mast
   cells in the brain mediate anxious behavior in mice. They also found
   that the nervous system protein GnRH promotes reproductive behavior as
   well as directs the pituitary to stimulate the ovaries and testes. Dr.
   Pfaff's lab discovered that GnRH-producing neurons emerge from the
   olfactory epithelium and migrate up the nose and into the forebrain and
   that genetic interruption of that migration, especially in men, results
   in inadequate testosterone and loss of libido.

   Dr. Pfaff's study of generalized arousal, which activates all
   behavioral responses, led to the first operational definition of the
   term, enabling scientists to measure arousal quantitatively in
   laboratory animals and humans. In humans, deficits in arousal
   contribute to cognitive problems such as attention
   deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism and Alzheimer's disease, and
   analyzing the mechanisms of arousal may lead to pharmacological methods
   to enhance alertness and sleep, and to more precise anesthesiology.
   Recently, Dr. Pfaff and his colleagues pitted two forces of arousal --
   hunger and circadian rhythms -- against each other, showing that these
   two pathways converge at the ventromedial hypothalamus and that this
   brain region is the first to register changes in food availability.

   In conjunction with Alex Proekt, a visiting fellow in the lab, Dr.
   Pfaff and his team are using mathematical statistics to search for the
   quantitative properties of a brain emerging from a nonaroused state to
   an aroused state. Dr. Proekt demonstrated that the transition from
   inactivity to the activation of behavior follows a power law and then
   showed that emergence from anesthetic-caused unconsciousness is not a
   smooth, monotonic process but instead requires the brain to dwell
   temporarily in dynamic "hub states." The team is interested in
   understanding the temporal patterns of neural activity in arousal
   systems that explain a person's emergence from anesthesia.

   Finally, studies in the lab have indicated that the origins of central
   nervous system arousal reside in the activities of large neurons, deep
   in the hindbrain, called nucleus gigantocellularis. A postdoc in the
   lab, Inna Tabansky, is using stem cell technology to produce these
   neurons from mouse embryonic stem cells. In parallel, her team is
   studying the normal lineage of nucleus gigantocellularis in the
   developing mouse brain. Taken together, her studies will address
   questions on the origins of arousal and have implications for certain
   neurodevelopmental disorders.

CAREER

   Dr. Pfaff graduated from Harvard College magna cum laude and received
   his Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1965. He
   joined Rockefeller in 1966 as a postdoc and was named assistant
   professor in 1969. He was granted tenure in 1973 and promoted to full
   professor in 1978.

   Dr. Pfaff is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow
   of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The author of several
   books on the brain and behavior, he received the 2005 Award for
   Excellence in Professional and Scholarly Publishing (medical science
   category) of the Association of American Publishers for his book, Brain
   Arousal and Information Theory. He received the 2010 Ipsen Foundation
   Prize in Neuronal Plasticity and the Daniel S. Lehrman Lifetime
   Achievement Award in Behavioral Neuroendocrinology in 2011.

   Dr. Pfaff is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
