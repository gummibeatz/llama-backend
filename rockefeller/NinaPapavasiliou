Faculty Bio

   F. Nina Papavasiliou

   DNA diversification processes are widely used to diversify cellular
   proteomes; for example, to generate antibodies against pathogen entry.
   Many pathogens have evolved similar mechanisms to alter their surface
   antigens, thereby evading the antibody response. Cells and organisms
   have also evolved to alter their RNA with specific outcomes such as
   genetic code recoding or gene expression reprogramming. Dr.
   Papavasiliou's research focuses on the different molecular processes
   that cells and organisms employ to diversify and expand the information
   encoded in their genomes.

   Using a combination of biochemistry and genetics, Dr. Papavasiliou is
   studying the molecular basis of the specific type of DNA mutation that
   underlies the diversification of antibodies in the B lymphocytes of the
   immune system. When B cells, specialized cells that produce antibodies
   against foreign molecules, encounter an antigen, mutations are
   introduced in the genes of their B cell receptors that recognize that
   antigen. This hypermutation process helps some of those B cells to
   acquire a higher affinity for the antigen, and those cells then become
   selected for survival; i.e., the immune system selects the B cells that
   are the best candidates for long-term memory against the antigen.
   Without somatic hypermutation, an individual may become
   immunocompromised in the ability to deal with antigens.

   Hypermutation in B cells is dependent on a protein called
   activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). When AID is expressed in
   these cells, it changes cytidine residues in the DNA to uracil, which
   is then recognized as DNA damage. Normally, the cell repairs uracil
   lesions by properly converting them back to cytidine; somehow, in B
   cells, the damaged antibody genes are misrepaired, such that the uracil
   lesion is converted to thymidine. How AID targets antibody genes for
   deamination and why uracil lesions in antibody genes are misrepaired,
   even though they are properly repaired in all other contexts, are
   questions under investigation in the Papavasiliou lab.

   B cells use DNA mutation to diversify and expand their antibody
   repertoire, which they need to block entry and eventually remove
   pathogens. Other organisms use DNA recombination to diversify their
   surface receptors and specifically evade antibody recognition. For
   instance, surface antigen variation in parasites like the African
   trypanosome (Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of sleeping
   sickness) is generated by gene conversion between silent cassettes and
   one active expression site. Understanding the mechanism that initiates
   targeted gene conversion in these parasites is an active area of
   interest in the lab (and an ongoing collaboration with Rockefeller's
   George A.M. Cross).

   AID belongs to the AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminase enzymes,
   most of which deaminate DNA to initiate DNA mutation. One of these,
   however, the APOBEC-1 deaminase, functions not as a DNA mutator but as
   an RNA "editor." Using transcriptome-wide binary comparisons between a
   genomic DNA sequence and the sequence of its RNA transcript, the
   Papavasiliou lab has uncovered multiple instances of APOBEC-1 editing
   that resulted in C-to-U changes in the edited transcript (noted as
   C-to-T differences between genomic DNA and messenger RNA), which
   effectively reprogram gene expression. The lab is keenly interested in
   further understanding the functional relevance of these changes at the
   organismal level.

   Finally, these genome/transcriptome comparisons have revealed a
   multitude of RNA/DNA alterations that occur at high frequency but
   cannot be attributed to cytidine deamination. These occur both in
   coding regions and in regulatory regions, and the lab is currently
   devising methods to first catalog these and to then characterize them
   functionally. Altogether, these preliminary findings reveal an
   extraordinary level of informational plasticity in biological systems.

CAREER

   Originally from Greece, Dr. Papavasiliou received her undergraduate
   degree in biology, with a minor in German literature, from Oberlin
   College in 1992. She completed her Ph.D. in molecular immunology in
   1998 at The Rockefeller University. After postdoctoral studies at Yale
   University, Dr. Papavasiliou returned to Rockefeller as assistant
   professor in 2001, becoming associate professor in 2007.

   She is a 2002 Keck Fellow and a 2003 Searle Scholar. She is also the
   recipient of a Sinsheimer Fund Scholar Award (2005), a Thorbecke Award
   from the Society for Leukocyte Biology (2006) and an NIH Director's
   Transformative Research Project Award (2011).

   Dr. Papavasiliou is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
