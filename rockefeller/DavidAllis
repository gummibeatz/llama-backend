   C. David Allis

   Although every gene exists within every cell in the human body, only a
   small percentage of genes is activated in any given cell. To manage
   this genetic information efficiently, nature has evolved a
   sophisticated system that facilitates access to specific genes. Dr.
   Allis studies the DNA-histone protein complex called chromatin, which
   packages the genetic information that exists within each cell and
   serves as a means of gene regulation that lies outside of the DNA
   itself -- the basis of epigenetics.

   Chromatin is the physiological template of the human genome. Elaborate
   mechanisms have evolved to introduce meaningful variation into
   chromatin to alter gene expression and other important biological
   processes. Three major mechanisms of this are covalent histone
   modifications, chromatin remodeling by ATP-dependent complexes and use
   of histone variants. Dr. Allis and his colleagues hypothesize that
   distinct patterns of covalent histone modifications form a histone or
   epigenetic "code" that is read by effector proteins to bring about
   distinct downstream events. Histone proteins, their posttranslational
   modifications and the enzyme systems responsible for generating them
   are highly conserved through evolution. The Allis lab is currently
   investigating different histone modifications and their biological
   roles in a variety of unicellular and multicellular eukaryotic models.
   Through such enzymatic processes as acetylation, methylation,
   phosphorylation and ubiquitylation, histones are believed to function
   like master on/off switches and determine whether particular genes are
   active or inactive. Knowing how to turn particular genes on or off
   could reduce the risk of certain diseases.

   The frequent, high-density posttranslational modifications (PTMs) in
   histone proteins have led members of the Allis laboratory to
   hypothesize that PTMs are located in strategic locations along the
   histone tail as a way for the cell to deal, reversibly, with gene
   silencing or, in contrast, gene activation. The lab has been a
   front-runner in deciphering elaborate cross talk relationships in the
   same histone tails (cis) or across distinct histone tails (trans). It
   appears that these regulatory pathways govern chromatin function during
   DNA replication and repair, chromosome segregation and chromatin
   compaction as cells undergo apoptosis. The combinatorial readout of
   distinct histone modifications that lead to the specification of unique
   downstream biological processes has been termed the "histone or
   epigenetic code" -- a widely cited and influential hypothesis.

   More recently, researchers in the Allis lab proposed that the mammalian
   genome is indexed by H3 variants in a nonrandom fashion reflecting the
   assembly mechanisms of dedicated, personalized chaperone proteins and
   exchange factors that control whether genes are constitutively
   expressed or remain silent. The Allis lab produced the first
   genome-wide maps of H3.3 localization, first in mammalian embryonic
   stem cells and then again after the cells had differentiated to become
   neurons. Biochemical approaches have led them to chaperone complexes
   that engage H3.3 selectively, depositing it into distinct regions of
   the genome. One of these chaperone systems (ATRX/Daxx targeting H3.3 to
   telomeres and other heterochromatic loci) has been shown to be mutated
   in a significant fraction of patients who suffer from pancreatic
   neuroendocrine tumors. Remarkably, H3.3 mutations are also highly
   specific to pediatric gliomas, a disease that is clinically and
   molecularly distinct from its adult counterpart. Dr. Allis and his
   colleagues hypothesize that these mutations can alter the recruitment
   and activity of histone-modifying complexes and therefore alter the
   epigenetic landscape and dysregulate gene expression. Given the
   restricted distribution of H3.3 mutations to pediatric gliomas, they
   further hypothesize that cell lineage-specific cellular context is
   crucial for the ability of these mutations to mediate oncogenesis.
   Active investigations are under way to test these hypotheses with
   collaborators in more clinically relevant settings, including human
   patients.

CAREER

   Dr. Allis received his Ph.D. in 1978 from Indiana University and
   performed postdoctoral work with Martin Gorovsky at the University of
   Rochester. Before he joined Rockefeller in 2003 as the Joy and Jack
   Fishman Professor and head of laboratory, Dr. Allis held several
   academic positions, including ones at the Baylor College of Medicine
   and the University of Virginia Health System.

   Dr. Allis is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the
   American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Among his many honors are the
   2014 Japan Prize, the 2011 Lewis S. Rosenstiel Award for Distinguished
   Work in Basic Medical Science, the 2008 ASBMB-Merck Award, the 2007
   Gairdner Foundation International Award, the 2004 Wiley Prize in
   Biomedical Sciences, the 2003 Massry Prize and the 2002 Dickson Prize
   in Biomedical Sciences.

   Dr. Allis is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program, the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program and the
   Tri-Institutional Ph.D. Program in Chemical Biology.
