   Alexander Tarakhovsky

   The interaction of immune cells with their environment leads to changes
   in the function of genes that contribute to effective immune response.
   These changes in gene expression, controlled by various signaling
   pathways, including those that converge at the chromatin level, are
   responsible for forming immune and nonimmune cell phenotypes that may
   persist for significant time periods. The Tarakhovsky lab studies the
   mechanisms by which pathogens affect chromatin function and how they
   affect long-lasting immune and nonimmune cell responses to the
   environment.

   Organism response to environmental stresses has both a predetermined,
   as well as an adaptive, nature. The predetermined response reflects the
   cell type-specific differences in signaling pathways and gene
   expression programs. In turn, adaptive responses reflect the ability of
   individual cells within a given lineage to integrate distinct
   environmental cues and to respond to them in a well-calibrated fashion.
   The predetermined and adaptive responses depend largely on tightly
   controlled gene expression programs that operate within limits imposed
   by a gene-specific chromatin environment. In the immune system, changes
   in chromatin are associated with, and contribute to, differentiation of
   hematopoietic stem cells into highly diverse immune cell
   subpopulations. Cell type-specific programs that drive responses of
   differentiated immune cells to pathogens differ significantly between B
   and T lineage cells as well as between cells of the adaptive and innate
   immune systems. The Tarakhovsky laboratory studies the mechanisms by
   which pathogens affect the function of chromatin, as well as how they
   affect long-lasting immune and nonimmune cell responses to the
   environment.

   Several years ago, the Tarakhovsky laboratory proposed the "histone
   mimicry" paradigm as a novel mechanism for regulation of gene
   expression. According to this paradigm, regulation of gene expression
   could be controlled by histone-like entities present in nonhistone
   proteins that can compete with histones for the regulators of gene
   expression. The foundation of this model originates from identification
   of the histone mimic within the histone methyltransferase G9a, which
   plays the important role of gene silencing. Further studies show the
   presence of histone mimics in a large number of human and mouse
   proteins. Furthermore, the laboratory found that pathogenic
   microorganisms carry histone mimics in the proteins that critically
   contribute to pathogen-mediated suppression of the host immune
   response. This finding led them to propose a mechanism according to
   which histone mimics in bacterial and viral proteins may serve as
   histone surrogates, thus hijacking chromatin-based pathways of immune
   response. The histone mimics concept led the Tarakhovsky laboratory to
   develop synthetic histone mimics that regulate inflammatory gene
   expression by interfering with association between histones and
   transcription regulators. In the future, the laboratory plans to extend
   its research toward an understanding of the mechanism of epigenetic
   conditioning of host cells by pathogens. This research may help to
   elucidate the basis of chronic inflammatory disorders that are
   initiated by infection but can persist in the absence of infectious
   agents.

CAREER

   Dr. Tarakhovsky received his medical degree from the Kiev Medical
   Institute in the Ukraine in 1978 and his Ph.D. from the Institute for
   Oncology at the Academy of Science in Kiev in 1982. He has worked as a
   research associate at the Institute for Oncology, the All-Union Cancer
   Research Center in Moscow and the Institute for Molecular Genetics in
   Tallinn, Estonia. In 1990 he joined the Institute of Genetics at the
   University of Cologne as a postdoc; he was promoted to group leader in
   1993 and tenured professor and head of the Laboratory of Lymphocyte
   Signaling in 1995. He moved to Rockefeller in 2000, when he was
   appointed Irene Diamond Associate Professor. He was named full
   professor in 2003.

   Dr. Tarakhovsky is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
