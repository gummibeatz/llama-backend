Faculty Bio

   Joseph Gleeson

   Dr. Gleeson seeks to understand the causes for pediatric brain diseases
   so as to improve their diagnosis and, when possible, identify
   treatments for conditions otherwise thought to be untreatable. To
   identify the genes responsible for recessive disorders, Dr. Gleeson
   recruits patients in regions of the world where marriage within
   extended families is relatively common, simplifying the search for
   inherited mutations. Ultimately, these results also contribute to the
   understanding of human brain development.

   Understanding the causes of brain disorders, particularly among
   children, presents unique challenges. The brain is less accessible than
   other organs; typical screening tests, such as magnetic resonance
   imaging, are not as predictive as once thought; and it has become
   apparent that multiple mutations may, individually, cause the same
   disorder, while any given mutation may lead to many different clinical
   presentations.

   Genetic sequencing technology allows researchers to look across all
   possible genes for a culprit, without introducing any bias based on
   preconceptions about the disorder. Dr. Gleeson uses high throughput
   exome sequencing to investigate the causes of pediatric brain
   disorders, often among children in highly susceptible families. The
   results have implications for not only the diagnosis, but also the
   treatment of patients. And the discoveries also support Dr. Gleeson's
   overarching goal: to better understand the development of the human
   brain.

   Dr. Gleeson's work originally focused on Joubert syndrome and double
   cortex syndrome. Joubert syndrome is an inherited malformation of the
   cerebellum and brain stem. The laboratory established Joubert syndrome
   as one of the ciliopathies, disorders due to defects in the function of
   neuronal primary cilia. The Gleeson lab established more than six
   different genetic causes and is currently investigating the mechanisms
   by which the disorder arises. He also identified the cause for double
   cortex syndrome, which is due to mutations in the doublecortin gene
   that cause defects in migration of neurons to the cerebral cortex. As
   the tools for gene sequencing have improved, he has expanded his focus
   to encompass a spectrum of devastating childhood neurological
   disorders, including autism, epilepsy, intellectual disability and
   structural disorders.

   Because disorders caused by single-gene mutations are extremely scarce
   within the general population, Dr. Gleeson collaborates with
   physician-scientists in the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia,
   where consanguineous marriage between relatives as close as first
   cousins is common, to recruit affected families. In these families, two
   unaffected parents often produce more than one affected child. Using
   samples from these families, the Gleeson laboratory identifies likely
   variations and builds a model, using stem cells, mice, cell biology or
   biochemistry-based methods, to predict the mechanism responsible.

   To date, the Gleeson laboratory has enrolled more than 3,000 families
   and examined more than 4,000 exomes, the largest single-lab experience
   in the U.S. From the growing candidate gene list, the lab prioritizes
   candidate genes that suggest possible treatments, often for conditions
   thought to be untreatable. In recent work, the Gleason lab identified a
   rare form of autism that involves epileptic seizures and intellectual
   deficits in three Middle Eastern families, and pinpointed its cause to
   be a mutation in the gene BCKDK. This mutation blocks the action of an
   enzyme that prevents the metabolism of essential branched-chain amino
   acids. Recent work points to the effectiveness of treatment with
   dietary branched-chain amino acids to treat this form of autism and
   epilepsy.

   Currently, most diagnostic sequencing is limited to the exome, the
   small portion of the genome containing DNA that codes for protein.
   However, Dr. Gleeson and others intend to use the uniquely accessible
   genetics of consanguineous families to help make sense of the rest of
   the genome, its so-called dark matter, and to transition to
   whole-genome sequencing, in collaboration with the New York Genome
   Center.

   With the dual goals of improving diagnosis and redefining disorders
   based on their genetic causes, rather than their symptoms, Dr. Gleeson
   also hopes to form collaborations with neurodevelopmental specialists
   in New York City in order to obtain sequences of patients' genomes
   early on during the diagnostic process.

CAREER

   Dr. Gleeson received his bachelor's degree in chemistry from the
   University of California, San Diego, in 1986 and earned his medical
   degree in 1991 from the University of Chicago's Pritzker School of
   Medicine with honors. He completed a residency in pediatric neurology
   at Children's Hospital in Boston and then did postdoctoral work at
   Harvard Medical School. In 1999, he joined the neuroscience faculty at
   the University of California, San Diego, and established the Center for
   Brain Development. He moved to Rockefeller in 2014. Dr. Gleeson has
   been a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator since 2008.

   Dr. Gleeson has received the Searle Scholars Award in 2000, the
   Klingenstein Award in Neurosciences in 2001, The Ray Thomas Edwards
   Award in Neurosciences in 2002, the Burroughs Wellcome Fund Award in
   Translational Research in 2005 and the Theodore Bullock Award in
   Neuroscience in 2006. He was named an investigator of the Simons Autism
   Foundation Research Initiative in 2010 and was elected to the
   Association of American Physicians and Institute of Medicine in 2013.

   Dr. Gleeson is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
