   George Reeke Jr.

   Chemical and electrical signals exchanged between cells can influence
   their growth, differentiation and interactions with other cells, giving
   rise to complex systems whose behavior is not easy to predict. Using
   computer simulations, Dr. Reeke's research is concerned with how the
   multiple components of biological systems work together to carry out
   complex functions, and with using those simulations to predict outcomes
   in different situations. By developing computer models of whole
   neuronal systems, which are the biological substrates for behavior and
   higher thought processes, Dr. Reeke seeks a greater understanding of
   how physical phenomena in the nervous system give rise to mental
   phenomena at the psychological level and behavior.

   As the nervous system develops, it must acquire adaptive behavior
   through interactions with the environment. Dr. Reeke's research
   simulates neural systems based on experimental neurophysiology with
   simulated or real sensors and locomotor organs and then challenges
   those systems to perform various tasks, shedding light on sensory
   integration, perceptual categorization, motor control and aspects of
   memory in normal and damaged or diseased brains. The models have shown
   how the ability to recognize objects and events in the environment can
   arise in the nervous system as a result of the operation of selective
   processes guided by innate value systems. Dr. Reeke's research
   indicates that there is no need for built-in representational codes or
   computational algorithms, nor for feedback of error signals from
   omniscient external teachers. The results call into question the
   popular theory that the brain is a kind of computer.

   Areas of particular interest in Dr. Reeke's lab are perception and
   control of locomotion and the development of analytic tools appropriate
   for the characterization of these activities in space and time. He is
   focusing on neural mechanisms for the recognition and recall of
   temporal patterns, which are of fundamental importance for planning and
   navigation, language and music. The lab has developed novel
   information-theoretic measures, based on the temporal intervals between
   events of interest, that will help to quantitate the temporal
   characteristics of the signals exchanged among neurons and the
   spatiotemporal discharge activity of neuronal assemblies.

   Dr. Reeke has shown that these same measures can be used to analyze
   data obtained from behavioral experiments with animals. In a
   collaborative project with Rockefeller's Donald W. Pfaff, Dr. Reeke
   helped measure the contribution of estrogens to exploratory behavior in
   female mice. The method could also be adapted to measure the
   contribution of a range of genes to behavior as well as to understand
   the effect of different genotypes or pharmacological manipulations on
   behavior.

   Dr. Reeke's lab has also developed a composite approach to modeling
   neurons in which the degree of detail employed in modeling different
   membrane conductances is adapted to the dynamical complexity of each
   neuron. For example, analysis of a model cerebellar Purkinje cell shows
   that when both the rate and the timing of a stimulus are varied, novel
   cell discharge behavior emerges. Studies of large-scale systems
   incorporating these data provide a greater understanding of how
   different types of neurons in both normal and diseased brains function
   at the integrated system level. These methods have been applied by
   members of the lab to study nonclassical responses of cells in the
   primary visual cortex, the process by which juvenile birds learn their
   songs, how general anesthetics affect the activities of neuronal
   clusters in the cerebral cortex, and the generation of descriptive
   models of sensorimotor contingencies and their relationship to reward
   in the cerebellum and other brain regions.

CAREER

   Dr. Reeke received his undergraduate degree in chemistry from the
   California Institute of Technology in 1964. He then moved to Harvard
   University, where he trained as a protein crystallographer, completing
   his M.A. in chemistry in 1966 and his Ph.D. in physical chemistry in
   1969. After a one-year postdoc at Harvard, Dr. Reeke moved to
   Rockefeller as assistant professor in 1970, becoming associate
   professor in 1976 and associate professor with tenure in 1987.

   Dr. Reeke received a National Science Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship
   and from 1975 to 1979 was an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellow. He is a
   member of the Society for Neuroscience, the International Neural
   Network Society, the Harvey Society and Sigma Xi. He is also a member
   of the editorial board of the Journal of Integrative Neuroscience.

   Dr. Reeke is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
