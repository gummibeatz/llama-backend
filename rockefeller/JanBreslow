Faculty Bio

   Jan Breslow

   Atherosclerotic disease, the hardening of the arteries that underlies
   coronary heart disease, stroke and peripheral vascular disease, is
   responsible for about 40 percent of the deaths in the United States
   each year. It is a complex genetic disease involving multiple genes and
   important gene-environment interactions. Dr. Breslow's laboratory
   explores the genetic basis of atherosclerosis, working to determine
   what makes certain individuals more or less susceptible to this
   disease, and pioneers novel therapies to fight it.

   Dr. Breslow's laboratory takes advantage of the availability of human
   populations, mouse models, genomic databases, high-density
   single-nucleotide polymorphism chips and gene expression microarrays,
   and genomic sequencing to detect genetic variations underlying
   atherosclerosis susceptibility in order to understand the complex
   genetic basis of this disease.

   Susceptibility to atherosclerosis is associated with abnormal levels of
   two cholesterol-carrying lipoproteins -- low-density lipoproteins
   (LDLs) and high-density lipoproteins (HDLs). Dr. Breslow has studied
   the apolipoproteins that coat lipoproteins, which affect the synthesis,
   processing and breakdown of lipoproteins and in some cases are related
   to coronary heart disease. He has cloned genes for apolipoproteins and
   made induced mutant mouse models to study these genes' functions in
   vivo.

   Dr. Breslow's laboratory created the first mouse model of
   atherosclerosis by knocking out the gene for apolipoprotein E (apo E),
   found on the surface of several lipoproteins. His laboratory bred the
   apo E knockout trait to different inbred genetic backgrounds, resulting
   in varying amounts of atherosclerosis and providing evidence for
   modifier genes. The Breslow laboratory has undertaken mouse crosses and
   quantitative trait locus mapping to identify new genes and pathways
   involved in atherosclerosis susceptibility.

   In another project, Dr. Breslow's lab has used gene expression
   microarrays to identify mouse liver genes whose expression is regulated
   by dietary cholesterol, work that has led to a new subclass of genes
   linked to cholesterol transport within cells. Another
   cholesterol-regulated gene discovered by this approach codes for an
   enzyme capable of destroying the LDL receptor, which clears LDL from
   the bloodstream. Inhibition of this enzyme could allow more receptors
   to reach the cell surface, lowering LDL cholesterol levels.

   Finally, in a collaborative project with Rockefeller's Jeffrey M.
   Friedman and investigators at Columbia, Harvard, MIT and Yale, Dr.
   Breslow is studying an isolated population on the Micronesian island
   Kosrae. Through family data, clinical and laboratory tests and
   determination of genetic markers in each adult Kosraen, the
   investigators are identifying genes that predispose an individual to
   obesity, diabetes, abnormal lipid levels and high blood pressure.

   Past accomplishments include discovering that human genetic variation
   in apo E resulted from three different apo E types. Specific patterns
   of inheritance of these apo E types are linked to LDL cholesterol
   levels, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and even longevity. Dr.
   Breslow was the first to identify at the molecular level a human
   mutation causing atherosclerosis susceptibility, an apo A-I mutation
   that causes HDL deficiency and premature coronary heart disease. His
   research has shown that overproduction of apo CIII is a major
   determinant of high triglyceride levels and that triglyceride-lowering
   drugs called fibrates act mainly by decreasing apo CIII production.

CAREER

   Dr. Breslow earned his A.B. and M.A. in 1963 and 1964, respectively,
   both in chemistry, from Columbia University. He received his M.D. from
   Harvard Medical School in 1968. After an internship and residency in
   pediatrics at Boston Children's Hospital and a post as staff associate
   at the Molecular Disease Branch of the National Heart and Lung
   Institute, he returned to Boston Children's Hospital in 1973 as chief
   of the metabolism division and assistant professor of pediatrics at
   Harvard Medical School. He joined Rockefeller in 1984 and was named
   Frederick Henry Leonhardt Professor in 1986. He is a senior attending
   physician at The Rockefeller University Hospital, where he also served
   as physician in chief in the early 1990s.

   Dr. Breslow is a past president of the American Heart Association and
   received its Gold Heart Award for exceptional service in 2001. For his
   research contributions, Dr. Breslow received the American Heart
   Association's Basic Research Prize in 1994, the Bristol-Myers Squibb
   Award for Distinguished Achievement in Cardiovascular Research in 2000,
   the New York City Mayor's Award for Excellence in Science and
   Technology in 2005 and the American Heart Association's Lifetime
   Research Achievement Award in 2010. Dr. Breslow was elected to the
   National Academy of Sciences in 1995 and the Institute of Medicine in
   1997.

   Dr. Breslow is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
