Faculty Bio

   Elaine Fuchs

   Skin harbors our largest reservoirs of stem cells. To maintain the body
   barrier, epidermis constantly self-renews and hair follicles undergo
   cyclical bouts of activity. Both stem cell compartments participate in
   repairing tissue damage after injury. Dr. Fuchs studies where adult
   stem cells come from, how they make tissues, how they repair wounds and
   how stem cells malfunction in cancers. Her group focuses on the
   mechanisms that impart skin stem cells with the ability to self-renew,
   develop and maintain tissues, and how these cells respond to external
   cues, and depart from their niche to accomplish these tasks.

   Skin stem cells have the remarkable capacity to self-renew in culture.
   Dr. Fuchs's laboratory couples in vitro studies with transgenic, gene
   knockout and short hairpin RNA technologies in mice and high throughput
   genomic analyses to unravel the molecular pathways that determine the
   normal balance between stem cell maintenance and differentiation, and
   how this goes awry in cancers. They are learning how embryonic and
   adult stem cells establish unique programs of gene expression that
   determine when they divide and what types of cells they develop into.
   Recent work in the Fuchs lab has shown that a structure at the base of
   each strand of hair, the hair follicle, uses mesenchymal-epithelial
   interactions to acquire a threshold of activating signals that instruct
   stem cells to divide during periods of hair growth. After the
   regeneration period, differentiated cells along the lineage return back
   to the niche, bringing inhibitory signals that return the stem cells to
   quiescence. These mechanisms provide new insights into how stem cells
   become activated to repair tissue upon injury, and deactivated once the
   wound is repaired. The work is accelerating the development of
   therapeutics to enhance wound repair.

   Dr. Fuchs's lab is also trying to understand how stem cells
   differentiate into hair follicles, skin epidermis and sweat glands.
   They have shown that different positive and negative signaling pathways
   need to be turned on and off at the right time and at the right place
   for adult skin stem cells to become hair follicles versus epidermis.
   These signaling pathways control distinct transcription factors and
   epigenetic modifications, as well as posttranscripitonal alterations in
   microRNAs, that change the program of gene expression necessary to
   develop each skin tissue. Dr. Fuchs's studies reveal new insights into
   why stem cells become more limited in their tissue options during
   development, and more limited altogether as we age.

   Dr. Fuchs's studies also reveal that cancer cells hijack the basic
   mechanisms that enable stem cells to replenish dying cells and to
   repair wounds. The focus is on squamous cell carcinomas, among the most
   common and life threatening of human cancers worldwide. The group used
   high throughput genomics to identify the distinguishing features of
   so-called "cancer stem cells" and devised technology that permits high
   throughput functional screens in mice. By identifying mutations that
   selectively fuel cancer growth, Dr. Fuchs's group hopes to devise new
   cancer therapeutics that target cancer stem cells without affecting
   normal stem cells.

   A final focus of the group is to uncover how changes in protein
   expression govern the packing of skin cells into different tissues and
   how this differs in cancer. How is the cytoskeleton polarized to orient
   the mitotic spindle? How do the cells reorient their cytoskeleton in
   response to injury so that the cells can migrate into the wound site?
   How can cells adhere to one another and yet dynamically turn over the
   skin epithelium to generate a brand new epidermis and regrow hairs? As
   the group probes deeper into understanding how stem cells make
   different kinds of tissues, they continue to uncover new links to
   understanding the process of wound repair as well as tumor progression
   and metastasis.

CAREER

   Dr. Fuchs received her B.S. in chemistry from the University of
   Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, in 1972 and her Ph.D. in biochemistry in
   1977 from Princeton University. She was a postdoc at MIT and was the
   Amgen Professor of Basic Sciences at the University of Chicago from
   1980 to 2002, when she joined Rockefeller. She has been a Howard Hughes
   Medical Institute investigator since 1988.

   Dr. Fuchs has received the 2014 Pezcoller Foundation Award for Cancer
   Research, 2013 Pasarow Award for Cancer Research, 2013 Kligman-Frost
   Leadership Award, 2013 American Skin Association Lifetime Achievement
   Award, 2012 March of Dimes Prize in Developmental Biology, 2011 Albany
   Medical Center Prize in Medicine and Biomedical Research, 2011 Passano
   Prize, 2011 Madison Medal, 2010 L'Oréal-UNESCO Award in the Life
   Sciences, 2010 Charlotte Friend Award from the American Association for
   Cancer Research, 2009 National Medal of Science, 2006 Bering Award,
   2006 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology Award
   for Scientific Excellence, 2004 Dickson Prize in Medicine, 2003
   Novartis/Drew Award in Biomedical Research, 2002 Cartwright Award from
   Columbia University and the 1997 Women in Cell Biology Senior Women's
   Career Achievement Award. She is a member of the National Academy of
   Sciences and its Institute of Medicine, the American Academy of Arts
   and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society. She was named one
   of the Nation's Outstanding Scientists by the White House in 1985 and
   holds honorary doctorates from the University of Illinois and the Mount
   Sinai and New York University Schools of Medicine.

   Dr. Fuchs is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
