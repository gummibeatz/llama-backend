   Tarun Kapoor

   A cell's ability to accurately segregate genetic material during
   division is essential for the survival of an organism, and errors can
   result in developmental defects and diseases. Dr. Kapoor's laboratory
   works at the interface of chemistry and biology to investigate the
   molecular and physical mechanisms that explain how exactly one copy of
   the genome is delivered to each daughter cell during cell division.

   Human cells divide approximately 10,000 trillion times during a
   lifetime. During cell division, cells must suspend DNA repair, protein
   synthesis and other essential activities. As a result, cells need to
   complete cell division quickly and precisely; in human cells, this
   process requires only an hour. If the metaphase spindle does not
   properly separate the parent cell's DNA to the two daughter cells,
   diseases, such as cancer, and developmental defects, such as Down
   syndrome, may result. Dr. Kapoor is interested in understanding the
   fundamental mechanisms that allow cells to achieve this delicate
   balance between speed and accuracy.

   The complex, sequential and rapid nature of this process makes it
   difficult to study, and, because of the limitations of conventional
   approaches, several basic questions about the operation and function of
   the mitotic spindle remain unanswered. Typically, researchers must
   choose either whole-system studies that do not offer precise insight
   into biochemical details, or studies of proteins in isolation and out
   of their physiological context. Dr. Kapoor develops chemistry-based
   approaches to close this gap.

   His lab has discovered and synthesized small organic molecules that can
   enter cells and interfere with cell division processes within minutes
   or seconds. The effect of these inhibitors can then be reversed to see
   how the cell recovers. This reversible "shutting off" of a process at a
   precise time point can be challenging to perform with other approaches.
   Dr. Kapoor's lab is currently working to identify chemicals that can
   interfere with the assembly of microtubule-based structures. For
   instance, Dr. Kapoor and colleagues identified small molecules known as
   ciliobrevins. They used these to block the activity of the motor
   protein cytoplasmic dynein, which is involved in many cellular
   processes. This discovery allowed them to probe cytoplasmic dynein's
   role in ciliary trafficking, mitotic spindle formation and organelle
   transport.

   In addition to developing methods for the discovery, chemical synthesis
   and characterization of bioactive small molecules, Dr. Kapoor is
   establishing assays to study how the cell assembles the micron-scale
   structures necessary for cell division. These structures are the
   product of nanometer-sized proteins decoding micron-sized geometric
   attributes, such as microtubule length and orientation. In recent work,
   Dr. Kapoor's lab has shown how two proteins, PRC1 and kinesin-4, mark
   the plus ends of microtubules with tags proportional to the length of
   the microtubules but one thousand times bigger than PRC1 and kinesin-4.
   These tags may help the cell select and organize microtubules to
   position the cell division plane and keep chromosomes segregated during
   the final stages of division.

   The quest to better understand cell division has immediate implications
   for medicine because it can lead to the development of therapies for
   diseases associated with improper division. In addition, the
   small-molecule probes Dr. Kapoor and his lab members identified have
   the potential to serve as templates for drugs and to help validate new
   targets for chemotherapeutics.

CAREER

   Dr. Kapoor graduated with honors from the California Institute of
   Technology with bachelor's degrees in chemistry and biology in 1993. He
   received his Ph.D. in chemistry in 1998 from Harvard University and did
   his postdoctoral research at Harvard Medical School. He came to
   Rockefeller in 2001 as assistant professor and was named associate
   professor in 2005 and professor in 2008.

   Dr. Kapoor received the 2012 Irving Sigal Young Investigator Award from
   The Protein Society and a Leukemia and Lymphoma Society Scholar Award
   in 2008. In 2003 he was named a Pew Fellow in the Biomedical Sciences.

   Dr. Kapoor is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program, the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program and
   the Tri-Institutional Ph.D. Program in Chemical Biology.
