   Vanessa Ruta

   Animal behavior reflects the interplay of instinct and learning. The
   Ruta lab is interested in defining the functional architecture and
   algorithms of the innate and adaptive neural circuits that animals use
   to navigate their sensory world.

   All animals exhibit stereotyped behavioral responses to certain sensory
   cues. These innate behaviors reflect the activation of genetically
   determined neural circuits selected over the course of evolution to
   ensure robust responses to sensory stimuli critical to survival and
   reproduction. However, to flexibly adapt to a dynamic and often
   unpredictable sensory environment, animals must also learn to modify
   innate behavioral responses based on prior experience. These learned
   behaviors are mediated by neural circuits that adapt much more rapidly,
   within the lifetime of an individual, to allow each animal to
   appropriately respond to its unique sensory experiences. The Ruta lab
   is interested in delineating the distinct neural circuits and
   computations that underlie innate and learned behaviors and in
   revealing circuits that can be modified through evolution or individual
   experience to generate novel behavioral adaptations.

   The Ruta lab examines questions of circuit organization, function,
   evolution and plasticity in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, an
   animal that displays a rich repertoire of innate and learned behaviors
   governed by a brain of only approximately 100,000 neurons. A goal of
   the lab is to exploit the numerical simplicity of the fly's nervous
   system to trace neural circuits from the detection of sensory cues all
   the way through to implementation of a motor response. By
   characterizing these extended neural processing pathways, Dr. Ruta
   hopes to reveal conserved circuit mechanisms that translate sensation
   into action. Areas of current focus include revealing the stereotyped
   pheromone-responsive circuits that enable a male to choose an
   appropriate prospective mate and the flexible circuits that allow a fly
   to impart meaning and contextualize a rich array of other olfactory
   experiences. Dr. Ruta and her colleagues use a variety of technical
   approaches to reveal and probe neural circuits, including novel optical
   tracing techniques, intracellular and extracellular
   electrophysiological recordings and functional calcium imaging. These
   anatomic and functional methods are combined with quantitative
   behavioral assays in both freely performing flies and tethered animals
   to allow for simultaneous measurement of neural activity and associated
   behavioral output.

   Dr. Ruta is also interested in considering how sensation is converted
   to action at the molecular level. All olfactory behaviors in the fly,
   whether innate or learned, are initiated through the same molecular
   recognition events: the binding of volatile chemical cues in the
   environment to odorant receptors expressed in peripheral sensory
   neurons. Odorant receptors in insects, unlike in mammals, are thought
   to function as heteromeric ion channels. To begin to reveal the
   mechanism that couples the binding of odorant ligands to ion flux in
   this large and diverse family of membrane proteins, the Ruta lab is
   performing biochemical, electrophysiological and structural studies on
   insect odorant receptors. The aim of these studies is to provide
   insight into the molecular mechanism of odorant signaling in insects
   and to lay the foundation for the development of novel strategies to
   prevent the transmission of insect-borne diseases.

CAREER

   Dr. Ruta received her B.A. in chemistry from Hunter College and her
   Ph.D. from The Rockefeller University in 2005, where she was a member
   of Roderick MacKinnon's laboratory. She conducted post- doctoral
   research in Richard Axel's laboratory at Columbia University and joined
   Rockefeller as assistant professor in 2011. She was named Gabrielle H.
   Reem and Herbert J. Kayden Assistant Professor in 2013.

   Dr. Ruta was named a New York Stem Cell Foundation-Robertson
   Neuroscience Investigator, a Pew Scholar in Biomedical Science, a
   McKnight Neuroscience Scholar, and a Sinsheimer Foundation Scholar in
   2012 and an Irma T. Hirschl/Monique Weill-Caulier Trusts Research
   Awardee and an Alfred P. Sloan Research Scholar in 2013. Dr. Ruta was
   also the recipient of a 2013 NIH Director's New Innovator Award. She
   received a Helen Hay Whitney Postdoctoral Fellowship in 2007, the
   Harold M. Weintraub Graduate Student Award in 2005 and a David
   Rockefeller Fellowship in 2003.

   Dr. Ruta is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program, the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program and
   the Tri-Institutional Ph.D. Program in Chemical Biology.
