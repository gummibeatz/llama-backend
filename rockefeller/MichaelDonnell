   Michael O'Donnell

   The elegant structure of duplex DNA suggests that the replication
   process would be simple. Duplication of the chromosomes, however,
   requires numerous proteins acting together to unwind and replicate the
   two strands of duplex DNA. Dr. O'Donnell's laboratory studies these
   replication mechanisms with the goal of understanding how the protein
   gears act together to make copies of DNA and how they function with
   repair and recombination factors to ensure that those copies are
   accurate.

   Over the years, research from Dr. O'Donnell's lab has provided an
   overview of how the replication machine functions in Escherichia coli,
   and several of its features have been found to be common to yeast and
   humans. A circular protein, which he and his colleagues refer to as a
   sliding clamp, completely encircles duplex DNA, acting as a mobile
   tether to hold the replication machine to the chromosome as it
   functions. The sliding clamps of prokaryote (b) and eukaryote
   proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) have similar structure and
   function. Dr. O'Donnell solved the structures of these ring-shaped
   proteins in collaboration with John Kuriyan's laboratory (now at the
   University of California, Berkeley) and showed that they comprise six
   domains organized on a dimer or trimer surface. Once on DNA, the clamp
   binds the replication machinery and slides along behind it, constantly
   holding it to the chromosome for long distances.

   To become attached to DNA, sliding clamps require a multiprotein clamp
   loader machine that uses adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to open the
   circular clamp and place it onto DNA. The detailed workings of how
   these clamp loaders function have been one of the lab's aims in both
   prokaryotic (g complex) and eukaryotic (RF-C) systems. Biochemical
   studies by Dr. O'Donnell's group, combined with crystal structure
   information from Dr. Kuriyan's laboratory, show that these clamp
   loaders are circular heteropentamers of crescent-shaped subunits that
   act like a hand with fingers; ATP binding powers the hand to manipulate
   the ring-shaped clamp onto DNA, and ATP hydrolysis allows the ring to
   close. Understanding the process by which two DNA polymerases cooperate
   with one clamp loader and a hexameric ring-shaped helicase to
   simultaneously synthesize both strands of duplex DNA is a project that
   has also held Dr. O'Donnell's fascination over the past few years. He
   and his colleagues have learned about three point switches between
   primase, the clamp loader and DNA polymerase and the processes by which
   sliding clamps are recycled and regulated.

   New and recent studies into other, accompanying processes include how
   the replication machinery interfaces with proteins in repair, DNA
   damage checkpoint paths and recombination. For example, the sliding
   clamps interact directly with MutS and MutL, and the O'Donnell lab is
   studying how it functions in mismatch repair. The b and PCNA clamps
   also bind several other proteins, indicating that these clamps and
   clamp loaders are at the center of many DNA metabolic processes. Dr.
   O'Donnell's lab is initiating a project on the role of these proteins
   in recombinative repair in which the replication fork encounters a
   lesion that must be fixed by recombination and repair proteins.
   Scientists had widely anticipated that a replication fork would
   collapse upon encountering a lesion, but Dr. O'Donnell's group found
   that this is not the case. Instead, blocks on the lagging strand are
   bypassed entirely by the replication machinery. Furthermore, the
   replication fork helicase itself is capable of encircling either one of
   two strands, and in the latter mode it is capable of branch migration
   of Holliday junctions, making it a likely candidate as a central actor
   in recombinative repair of a stalled replication fork.

   The O'Donnell lab is also studying how replication origins are
   activated for DNA synthesis, with the expectation that studies in the
   yeast system will lead to information on the overall control of
   chromosome replication.

CAREER

   Dr. O'Donnell received his Ph.D. at the University of Michigan, where
   he worked under Charles Williams Jr. on electron transfer in the
   flavoprotein thioredoxin reductase. He performed postdoctoral work on
   E. coli replication with Arthur Kornberg and then on herpes simplex
   virus replication with I. Robert Lehman, both in the biochemistry
   department at Stanford University. Dr. O'Donnell then became a member
   of the faculty of Weill Cornell Medical College in 1986 and an
   investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in 1992 before
   moving to Rockefeller in 1996. Dr. O'Donnell is a member of the
   National Academy of Sciences.

   Dr. O'Donnell is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
