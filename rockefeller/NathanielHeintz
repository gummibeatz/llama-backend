Faculty Bio

   Nathaniel Heintz

   Research in Dr. Heintz's laboratory aims to identify the genes,
   circuits, cells, macromolecular assemblies and individual molecules
   that contribute to the function and dysfunction of the mammalian brain.
   Dr. Heintz and his colleagues have developed a suite of novel
   approaches based on the manipulation of bacterial artificial
   chromosomes (BACs) to investigate the histological and functional
   complexities of the mammalian brain in vivo and to understand how these
   mechanisms become dysfunctional in disease.

   Research in the Heintz laboratory focuses on the following four areas:

   Genetic dissection of central nervous system (CNS) cell types and
   circuits. The Heintz laboratory invented DNA engineering by homologous
   recombination in E. coli ("recombineering") and demonstrated that
   engineered BAC transgenes can be reliably expressed in defined CNS cell
   types in vivo. Collaborating with Mary E. Hatten, the Heintz laboratory
   launched the NINDS Gene Expression Nervous System Atlas project
   (www.gensat.org), a large-scale screen using BAC transgenic mice to
   create an atlas of cellular CNS gene expression. It provides detailed
   anatomical data on cell types targeted in over 1,500 BAC transgenic
   mouse lines and provides a library of verified BAC vectors and
   transgenic mouse lines. This resource is a foundation for in-depth
   analysis of CNS cell types by hundreds of laboratories and provides the
   genetic tools used by the Heintz laboratory to investigate cellular and
   molecular mechanisms governing nervous system function.

   Translational profiling of CNS cell types in health and disease. The
   Heintz laboratory, in collaboration with Paul Greengard, developed the
   translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) technique. By fusing
   an affinity tag to a ribosomal protein, TRAP enables the isolation of
   bound messenger RNAs from a targeted cell type without requiring
   isolation of that cell type from tissue. The laboratory employs bacTRAP
   transgenic mice and TRAP profiling to determine molecular constitutions
   of a wide variety of cell types in the mouse brain and to determine the
   molecular phenotypes of select cell types in mouse models of autism
   spectrum disorders, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, addiction and
   depression. TRAP profiling has proven to be very powerful in
   identifying cell types responding to genetic perturbations or
   pharmacologic interventions and has led to the definition of
   biochemical pathways whose altered activity contributes to the
   pathophysiology of CNS disorders.

   Epigenetic regulation of the neuronal genome: the role of
   5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Over the last several decades, a strong
   connection between the presence of 5-methylcytosine (5mC), chromatin
   organization and gene expression has been established. While
   investigating the relationship between nuclear structure and the
   content of 5mC in cerebellar Purkinje and granule cell genomic DNA, the
   Heintz laboratory discovered 5hmC is present in the mammalian genome
   and specifically enriched in neurons. Dr. Heintz and his colleagues are
   addressing the potential impact of 5hmC, a novel epigenetic mark not
   previously observed in metazoans, on nuclear structure and gene
   expression, its significance for epigenetic mechanisms of neurological
   and psychiatric disease and its role in CNS development. Their recent
   finding that the Rett syndome protein MeCP2 binds with high affinity to
   5hmC has stimulated interest in the possible role of 5hmC neurological
   disease.

   Biochemical mechanisms of neuronal function. To investigate
   macromolecular assemblies that govern neuronal function in their native
   context, the Heintz laboratory has expressed fusion proteins in cell
   types of interest using BAC transgenic mice, prepared crude fractions
   enriched for the complexes of interest and affinity purified those
   complexes incorporating proteins of interest. In collaboration with
   Brian T. Chait, the laboratory has identified protein components of
   these complex machines using mass spectroscopy. For example, they
   characterized the biochemical properties of specific synapse types in
   the mammalian brain, revealing fundamental biochemical differences
   between excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Heintz and his
   collaborators have also characterized large complexes containing Beclin
   1, leading to identification of new mechanisms that participate in the
   regulation of autophagy and endocytosis. These studies demonstrate that
   in vivo biochemical profiling provides an important avenue toward
   deciphering the complex phenotypes encountered using conventional
   genetic perturbations.

CAREER

   Dr. Heintz graduated from Williams College with a B.A. in biology in
   1974. He received his Ph.D. from the State University of New York,
   Albany, in 1979 and then worked as a postdoc at Washington University
   in St. Louis until 1982. He came to Rockefeller as assistant professor
   in 1983 and was named associate professor in 1987, professor in 1992
   and James and Marilyn Simons Professor in 2006.

   Dr. Heintz was granted the American Cancer Society Junior Faculty
   Research Award in 1986. He was named a Pew Scholar in the Biomedical
   Sciences in 1985 and received a National Institutes of Health
   Postdoctoral Fellowship in 1981 and a Damon Runyon-Walter Winchell
   Cancer Fund Postdoctoral Fellowship in 1979. He is a fellow of the
   American Academy of Arts and Sciences and an investigator at the Howard
   Hughes Medical Institute.

   Dr. Heintz is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
