   Everything we see is the result of light-induced patterns of electrical
   activity in the nerve networks of the retina and brain. What we see,
   however, is processed into an intelligible form by complex
   transformations within these networks. Mr. Knight works to develop a
   description of these networks in mathematical equations that will allow
   scientists to predict how the system will respond to specific visual
   patterns.

   Mr. Knight and his colleagues study the visual part of the central
   nervous system, where they apply technology and theoretical means
   refined in their own laboratory in an effort to understand how the
   nervous system processes input information. Mr. Knight is specifically
   interested in the broad multicellular interactions among biophysical
   processes, which individually lie at the subcellular level. His
   laboratory's efforts demand the conjoined development of experimental
   procedures that induce and record detailed neural responses and
   theoretical tools, including dynamical equations and computer
   simulation, that may then describe those neural responses
   quantitatively. Because the visual sense provides unique opportunities
   for highly structured input, their efforts focus on the visual part of
   the central nervous system, particularly that of humans and those of
   other vertebrates whose visual systems share key features of
   evolutionary kinship with humans.

   Vision occurs when a stimulus -- moving patterns of colored light, for
   example -- arrives from the external visual world and induces dynamical
   patterns of electrical activity in a sequence of neural processing
   networks that start with the retina, which is specialized brain tissue,
   and continue into the brain. At each step, profound signal
   transformations occur that ultimately reduce the input to a form useful
   for action. Mr. Knight and his colleagues study that process with
   computer-generated stimuli, including modified natural-scene movies,
   designed by theoretical considerations that facilitate the
   interpretation of response features in terms of the responding system's
   predictive dynamical laws. Their data include single-cell recordings
   from identified nerve cells of anesthetized animals, overall
   stimulus-evoked potentials in experimental animals and in humans and
   direct quantitative reports by human observers.

   The lab's emphasis has been on the retina, the primary visual cortex
   and the lateral geniculate nucleus, which is a processing network
   between the retina and the cortex. Members of Mr. Knight's laboratory
   have been some of the principal contributors to our emerging
   understanding of the dynamics of the cat retina, which shows numerous
   dynamical features that prove typical of many vertebrates. Recent
   results with primate retinas from both monkeys and humans reveal not
   only cat-like cells, but a major additional interacting population with
   novel dynamical properties.

   Researchers in Mr. Knight's lab are currently investigating the
   dynamics of so-called relay neurons in the cat lateral geniculate
   nucleus via a technique they have developed that allows simultaneous
   electrical recording of both input and output nerve impulses in
   response to detailed computer-generated stimuli. They have shown that
   these cells can sculpt their throughput information in a manner much
   richer than their name would imply, and that response characteristics
   can be strongly modulated by nonretinal inputs from other brain
   regions.

   Recent detailed analysis of responses of retinal ganglion cells to
   time-dependent naturalistic stimuli reveals that they may be classified
   within a special subset of neuron designs that might be descriptively
   called "faithful copy neurons." A population of such neurons produces
   an aggregate firing rate that far better mimics its neural input than
   would different choices of neuron design. The way a network of such
   neurons behaves depends critically on the nature of interconnections
   and only insensitively on variations in the dynamics of the individual
   neurons. The generality of this feature and its implications for
   network design are currently under study.

   Recently, Mr. Knight's associates have been able to record
   simultaneously from numerous cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus.
   The responses of these cells naturally classify them into several
   response categories. By the creation of a new data analysis technique,
   it has proven possible to quantitatively measure the rate of
   information transfer through a group of such cells and also to measure
   the degree to which information transmitted by different cell groups is
   independent or redundant.

CAREER

   Mr. Knight received his B.A. in physics and mathematics from Dartmouth
   College in 1952. He joined Rockefeller in 1961 as an affiliate, after
   academic appointments at Cornell University and Los Alamos National
   Laboratory. In 1973 he became a tenured associate professor. He was
   named head of the Laboratory of Biophysics in 1986 and was promoted to
   full professor in 1988.

   Mr. Knight is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
