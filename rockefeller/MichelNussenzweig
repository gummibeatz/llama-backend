   Michel Nussenzweig

   Unlike many organ systems present throughout evolution, the immune
   system occurs only in vertebrates. Although this places a limit on
   classical genetic analysis, Dr. Nussenzweig's laboratory circumvents
   the problem by combining biochemistry and molecular biology with gene
   targeting and transgenic technologies to better understand the
   molecular aspects of adaptive and innate immune responses. He focuses
   on B lymphocytes and antibodies for adaptive immunity and on dendritic
   cells in his studies of innate immunity.

   The function of the immune system is to protect vertebrates from a
   multitude of different pathogens, and there are two types of immune
   responses that have evolved to accomplish this task: innate and
   adaptive immunity. Lymphocytes are the primary effectors of adaptive
   immunity and assemble a diverse repertoire of immune receptors using a
   somatic gene recombination process known as V(D)J recombination. This
   process enables the production of a very large number of unique
   receptors that are able to recognize almost any antigen, but it also
   produces self-reactive receptors, which must be silenced to prevent
   autoimmune diseases.

   A series of checkpoints has evolved to ensure that B cells emerging
   from the bone marrow carry functional and non-self-reactive antigen
   receptors. Dr. Nussenzweig's laboratory has examined the regulation of
   these checkpoints and found that many depend on signals from membrane
   immunoglobulin. In its absence, B cells fail to pass the checkpoints
   and die by apoptosis. Ongoing research focuses on understanding
   checkpoint regulation, the mechanisms that veto autoimmune antibody
   production and how this breaks down in autoimmune diseases.

   Although V(D)J recombination produces a multitude of antigen receptors,
   they are relatively low-affinity receptors that must be refined by
   somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination to produce the
   high-affinity antibodies that protect against most pathogens. The lab
   is investigating the molecular basis of these diversification reactions
   and how they can occasionally lead to cancer-associated chromosome
   translocations.

   A second area of interest for the Nussenzweig lab is the physiological
   function of dendritic cells. To examine the function of dendritic cells
   in the steady state, he and his colleagues devised an in vivo antigen
   delivery system that uses a monoclonal antibody and a dendritic
   cell-restricted endocytic receptor, DEC-205. This route of antigen
   delivery is several orders of magnitude more efficient in inducing T
   cell activation and cell division than free peptide in strong
   adjuvants. But the activation response is not sustained, and T cells
   become unresponsive to systemic rechallenge with antigen. Coinjection
   with anti-CD40 agonistic antibody changes the outcome from tolerance to
   prolonged T cell activation and immunity, indicating that in the steady
   state, the primary function of dendritic cells is to maintain
   peripheral tolerance.

   Dr. Nussenzweig's experiments are consistent with the notion that
   self-antigens induce tolerance. In contrast, antigens taken up by
   dendritic cells in the context of activation stimuli, such as those
   found during inflammation or tissue destruction, induce prolonged T
   cell activation. This steady-state tolerizing function of dendritic
   cells may be essential to their role in eliciting immunity. During
   inflammation or infection, they present self-antigens simultaneously
   with non-self-antigens. By establishing tolerance to self-antigens
   before challenge with pathogens, dendritic cells can focus the adaptive
   immune system entirely on the pathogen, thereby avoiding autoimmunity.
   The ability to target antigens to dendritic cells and control their
   function in vivo has significant implications for the development of
   vaccines and therapies for autoimmunity. Recently, the lab defined
   distinct progenitor lineages for classical spleen dendritic cells,
   plasmacytoid dendritic cells and monocytes, a useful step toward
   antigen-specific targeting.

CAREER

   Dr. Nussenzweig received his bachelor's degree from New York University
   in 1975. He received his Ph.D. in 1981 from The Rockefeller University,
   where he studied under Ralph M. Steinman, and his M.D. in 1982 from the
   New York University School of Medicine. He continued his clinical
   training at Massachusetts General Hospital, first as an intern and
   resident in internal medicine from 1982 to 1985 and then as a clinical
   fellow in infectious diseases from 1984 to 1985. In 1986 he began his
   postdoctoral research in genetics at Harvard Medical School and
   returned to Rockefeller in 1990 as assistant professor. He was named
   associate professor in 1994 and professor and senior physician in 1996.
   He has been an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute
   since 1999.

   Dr. Nussenzweig was elected to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences
   and the Brazilian Academy of Sciences in 2011 and the Institute of
   Medicine in 2009. He received the Lee C. Howley Sr. Prize for Arthritis
   Research in 2008, the American Association of Immunologists-Huang
   Foundation Meritorious Career Award in 2004 and the Solomon A. Berson
   Alumni Achievement Award for Basic Science from New York University in
   2003. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

   Dr. Nussenzweig is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
