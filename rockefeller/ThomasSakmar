Faculty Bio

   Thomas Sakmar

   Recent advances in molecular and structural studies of G protein
   coupled receptors (GPCRs) have revolutionized drug discovery.
   Dr. Sakmar uses chemical, biophysical and genetic methods to learn how
   signals from the outside of a cell are relayed across its membrane and
   into the cell's interior. Much of his work is focused on elucidating
   the principles that underlie ligand recognition in GPCRs and
   understanding with chemical precision how receptors change conformation
   in the membrane bilayer when ligands bind.

   The primary research focus of the Sakmar laboratory is to study the
   biology and chemistry of heptahelical GPCRs. The mechanism of signaling
   by heptahelical receptors is an area of intense scientific interest
   that has tremendous biological and pharmaceutical relevance:
   Heptahelical receptors represent the largest gene family in the human
   genome and the largest class of drug targets in the pharmaceutical
   industry. For the past five years, members of the Sakmar lab have been
   working to develop or adapt various innovative methods to establish a
   robust interdisciplinary approach to support the following long-term
   goals:

   1) To elucidate the basic principles that underlie ligand recognition
   and specificity in heptahelical receptors

   2) To understand the molecular mechanism of receptor activation and
   signaling, including the details of dynamic conformational changes
   required to switch a receptor from its "off" state to its "on" state

   3) To understand how specific receptor proteomics and posttranslational
   modifications such as glycosylation, acylation, phosphorylation and
   tyrosine sulfation affect receptor function

   4) To elucidate how receptors assemble in biological membrane bilayers
   and how the physical and chemical properties of the membrane affect
   receptor biology

   5) To establish a basic foundation for drug discovery aimed at
   modulating the pharmacological activity of heptahelical receptors
   responsible for disease states

   Dr. Sakmar's work has focused primarily on family A (rhodopsin family)
   GPCRs as a model system for biophysical studies and chemokine receptors
   for studies of ligand recognition and proteomics. Chemokine receptors
   control cell migration and also act as coreceptors for HIV-1 cellular
   entry. Other receptors and other aspects of G protein-mediated
   signaling are also under investigation. In particular, the lab is
   studying downstream cytoplasmic components of G protein signaling
   pathways, with a particular interest in defining protein-protein
   interactions that modulate cross talk between signaling pathways.

   In addition, the lab uses high throughput screening or high-content
   functional assays to characterize expressed mutant receptors and a
   variety of analytical methods to evaluate specific receptor structural
   heterogeneities.

CAREER

   Dr. Sakmar received his A.B. in chemistry from the University of
   Chicago and his M.D. from the University of Chicago Pritzker School of
   Medicine in 1982. He then completed an internship and residency in
   internal medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and
   conducted postdoctoral research in the laboratory of Nobel Prize winner
   H. Gobind Khorana in the departments of chemistry and biology at the
   Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He joined Rockefeller in 1990 as
   assistant professor and university fellow. He was promoted to tenured
   professor in 1998. Dr. Sakmar has been an investigator of the Howard
   Hughes Medical Institute and a senior scholar of the Ellison Medical
   Foundation. He was acting president of Rockefeller University from
   February 2002 to September 2003.

   Dr. Sakmar is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program, the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program and
   the Tri-Institutional Ph.D. Program in Chemical Biology.
