   Sean Brady

   Natural products -- or more generally, genetically encoded small
   molecules -- play a wide variety of roles in biology and have proved
   very useful in the development of small-molecule therapeutic agents.
   Dr. Brady's research centers on the discovery, biosynthesis and
   characterization of new, genetically encoded small molecules from
   microbial sources, with a special focus on those produced by uncultured
   soil bacteria and pathogenic bacteria.

   One of the key revelations from the large-scale sequencing of bacterial
   genomic DNA is that the approaches traditionally used for identifying
   new natural products only provide functional access to a small fraction
   of the biosynthetic gene clusters present in nature. These studies
   indicate that essentially all bacteria -- from those with fully
   sequenced genomes to those not yet cultured -- are rich sources of
   unstudied natural product biosynthetic gene clusters. Using methods
   from molecular biology, organic chemistry and microbiology, Dr. Brady
   is working to gain access to these previously inaccessible natural
   products and their biosynthetic gene clusters. The development of
   methods to functionally access the wealth of previously inaccessible
   natural product biosynthetic pathways known to be present in bacterial
   genomes should significantly increase the number and diversity of
   natural products available to test as probes of biological processes
   and therapeutic agents.

   Soil microbes that have not yet been cultured outnumber their cultured
   counterparts by at least two to three orders of magnitude. Uncultured
   bacteria are one of the largest pools of genetic diversity that remain
   unexamined for the production of potentially useful natural products.
   Dr. Brady's first research focus is the development of new strategies
   for studying genetically encoded small molecules produced by uncultured
   bacteria. Although most bacteria are not readily grown in the
   laboratory, making it difficult to use traditional microbiological
   methods to characterize the natural products they create, microbial DNA
   can be extracted directly from environmental samples and cloned in
   easily cultured bacteria. Dr. Brady has worked extensively on the
   development of genetic strategies to access the vast chemical and
   biosynthetic potential of uncultured, previously inaccessible,
   bacteria. This has allowed for the construction of large libraries of
   environmental DNA, as well as the development of methods to screen
   these libraries. Such culture-independent methods are leading Dr. Brady
   to identify new natural products, biosynthetic enzymes and bacterial
   signaling systems. Dr. Brady's work has shown that large environmental
   DNA libraries are a promising source of both new derivatives of
   pharmacologically important classes of natural products as well as
   completely novel families of bioactive natural products. His group has
   begun mapping the presence of promising microbial gene clusters found
   in soil samples collected around the world. These maps may help guide
   the discovery of natural products by directing investigators to certain
   regions and environments.

   The second focus of the Brady lab, the chemistry of human
   microbiome-associated and pathogenic bacteria, could one day help
   address the problem of drug-resistant bacteria. Pathogenic bacteria
   have evolved elaborate signaling systems and toxins vital to their
   ability to initiate and maintain infections. The annotation of
   completely sequenced bacterial genomes has led to the identification of
   natural product biosynthetic gene clusters whose predicted products do
   not correspond to any molecules previously characterized from these
   organisms. Dr. Brady uses bioinformatics to examine the genomes of
   sequenced bacteria, looking to identify gene clusters that could code
   for novel signaling molecules and toxins. By studying the complex
   collections of small molecules used by bacterial pathogens, he hopes to
   gain new insight into the molecules used during infection and, in turn,
   determine how to best disrupt key steps in the establishment and
   propagation of bacterial infections.

CAREER

   Dr. Brady graduated with a degree in molecular biology in 1993 from
   Pomona College. He received his Ph.D. in organic chemistry in 2001 from
   Cornell University, where he studied under Jon Clardy. In 2002 he moved
   to Harvard Medical School as a fellow in the Institute of Chemistry and
   Cell Biology. He was named an instructor in the department of
   biological chemistry and molecular pharmacology at Harvard Medical
   School in 2004 and moved to Rockefeller as assistant professor in 2006.
   He was promoted to associate professor in 2012.

   Dr. Brady received a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Early Career
   Scientist Award in 2009. In 2007 he was named a Searle Scholar, an Irma
   T. Hirschl Scholar, an Alexandrine and Alexander L. Sinsheimer Scholar
   and an Arnold and Mabel Beckman Young Investigator.

   Dr. Brady is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program, the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program and
   the Tri-Institutional Ph.D. Program in Chemical Biology.
