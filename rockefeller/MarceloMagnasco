Faculty Bio

   Marcelo Magnasco

   Dr. Magnasco leads a group of physicists who use living beings as a
   source of inspiration for creating new mathematical descriptions of
   nature. The lab's main focus is on computational and experimental
   neurophysiology, primarily auditory function but also touching on
   vision, memory, olfaction and other sensory processing, as well as
   studies of animal communication in species from songbirds to dolphins.

   Dr. Magnasco uses both computational and experimental methods to model
   the complexity, organization and information-processing properties of
   living organisms. The lab concentrates on sensory processing:
   Experimental techniques are employed to investigate the auditory
   representation of complex objects in laboratory animals as well as
   humans, and study communication in dolphins, while computer modeling is
   used to understand how and where sound is processed in the mammalian
   brain.

   The experimental side of the Magnasco lab aims to understand how the
   brain processes and represents complex sounds. For instance, of keen
   interest to the group is a family of sounds called auditory textures --
   such as a crackling fire or falling rain -- that have a statistical
   homogeneity that makes them analyzable. These sounds are of great
   biological relevance: first, because the sounds themselves have
   intrinsic survival value, as finding water or escaping forest fires are
   important across species; and second, because all auditory detection of
   prey and predators is carried out against a backdrop of such sounds.
   Perception of such textures has been explored electrophysiologically in
   rodents and psychoacoustically in humans.

   Dr. Magnasco's computational studies include both abstract modeling as
   well as data analysis efforts. Modeling work is under way on neural
   architectures of auditory processing, including frequency
   discrimination and spatial perception models, as well as on neural
   function and memory, such as mechanisms employed by the brain to
   balance excitatory and inhibitory activity in neural circuits. Data
   analysis work concentrates on methods to analyze large-scale
   neurophysiological datasets, such as those stemming from
   eco-corticography recordings in humans and primates.

   Another research line in the lab has focused on vascular networks as
   archetypes of complex biological function from simple components. The
   group has studied venation of tree leaves, a complex biological network
   with interesting topological and geometrical features, and has recently
   created methods to section whole rodent livers and reconstruct their
   three-dimensional vascular structure in unprecedented detail.

   Prior work from the Magnasco lab has touched on many aspects of sensory
   processing, including auditory, visual and olfactory. His work with
   Rockefeller's A. James Hudspeth resulted in the creation of a
   mathematical model of a "trapdoor amplifier" in the hair cells of the
   inner ear, research that challenged some of the most basic assumptions
   about how the human ear processes sound. His work in birdsong, which
   followed expression of the ZENK gene, allowed researchers to watch song
   learning and memory at the cellular level in the brains of canaries.
   Furthermore, in a sound analysis breakthrough, Dr. Magnasco created
   an algorithm that transforms sound into visual representations with far
   more accuracy than anything currently available and that may use the
   same type of method as the human brain.

CAREER

   Dr. Magnasco graduated from the National University of La Plata in
   Argentina with a bachelor's degree in physics in 1987. He received his
   Ph.D. in physics from the University of Chicago in 1992 and then came
   to Rockefeller as a postdoc and visiting scientist at the NEC Research
   Institute. The following year, he was named assistant professor and
   head of laboratory, the first faculty member recruited to Rockefeller's
   Center for Studies in Physics and Biology. He was promoted to associate
   professor in 1999 and professor in 2003. From July 2002 through July
   2003 he also worked as a research scientist at UNESCO's Abdus Salam
   International Center for Theoretical Physics.

   In 1991 Dr. Magnasco was named the University of Chicago's Sydney
   Bloomenthal Dissertation Fellow and the William Rainey Harper
   Dissertation-Year Fellow.

   Dr. Magnasco is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
