   Cell membranes contain millions of embedded proteins that control ion
   movements into and out of the cell. This ion flow underlies such vital
   functions as electrical signaling in nerve, heart and muscle cells,
   cell volume regulation, secretion of hormones and neurotransmitters,
   fertilization and kidney function. Dr. Gadsby's research focuses on how
   ion transport proteins work.

   Two principal classes of proteins regulate ion movement across
   membranes: pumps and channels. Although both move ions through the
   cell's otherwise impenetrable phospholipid bilayer, they play distinct
   roles. Channels allow ions to flow rapidly down their electrochemical
   gradients, while pumps move ions relatively slowly, thermodynamically
   uphill, thereby building up those gradients. Pumps and channels have
   therefore traditionally been viewed as very different entities. Dr.
   Gadsby's work, however, suggests these membrane proteins are far more
   closely related than generally assumed.

   The Gadsby lab is using position-specific mutagenesis, combined with
   structural modeling and biochemical and electrical measurements, to
   examine the mechanisms of two biomedically important ion transport
   proteins. One, the Na^+/K^+-adenosine triphosphatase, is a pump, and
   the other, the cystic fibrosis-linked protein known as CFTR (cystic
   fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), is a Cl^- ion channel.
   The Na^+/K^+ pump establishes the transmembrane gradients of Na^+ and
   K^+ ions crucial to animal cell life, whereas CFTR channels conduct
   Cl^- ions across membranes of epithelial cells, allowing simultaneous
   movement of water. Mutations in the CFTR gene are responsible for
   cystic fibrosis. Mutations in the Na^+/K^+ pumps of brain neurons have
   recently been found responsible for neurological disorders in children.

   Research from the Gadsby lab suggests that, just as an ion channel can
   be viewed as an ion pathway controlled by a gate at one end, an ion
   pump can be viewed as a modified ion channel controlled by gates at
   both ends. The gates in a pump must be tightly coupled so they are
   never both open simultaneously. From this perspective, the
   conformational changes that open and close the ion pathway gates in the
   two kinds of transport need not be all that different. Indeed, in both
   the Na^+/K^+ pump and CFTR Cl^- channel, these conformational changes
   are driven by binding and hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

   In work on CFTR, lab members use the sensitive patch-clamp recording
   technique to analyze the timing of the opening and closing of
   individual wild-type and mutant CFTR channels as they are exposed to
   ATP and/or nucleotide analogues. So far, they have found that ATP binds
   to both nucleotide-binding domains in a single CFTR molecule before the
   gate in its channel opens, that the two binding sites interact to
   regulate each other's function and that one of them acts like a G
   protein. The nucleotide bound there stabilizes the active, open-channel
   conformation until its hydrolysis prompts channel closure. From such
   findings, the Gadsby lab has detailed the accepted model for how the
   opening and closing of the CFTR ion channel is regulated, furthering
   understanding of the origins of cystic fibrosis.

   In work on the Na^+/K^+ pump, a marine toxin has been used that
   interferes with the strict coupling between the pump's two gates. When
   the toxin is bound to the pump, the two gates are occasionally both
   open, and the pump is transformed into an ion channel. Dr. Gadsby is
   exploiting this action to probe the pathway through the Na^+/K^+ pump
   as well as the nature and control of its gates. In work on unmodified
   native Na^+/K^+ pumps, Dr. Gadsby and colleagues have shown the pumps
   release three Na^+ ions to the cell exterior in three distinct,
   obligatorily sequential, gating steps, with progressively faster
   speeds. Most recently, the Gadsby lab has found that during the normal
   Na^+/K^+ transport cycle, a certain conformation of the Na^+/K^+ pump
   can be hijacked by extracellular protons to access the cell interior.
   The probability of proton entry through any given Na^+/K^+ pump depends
   on the extracellular proton concentration. The Na^+/K^+ pump is thus a
   hybrid transporter, a protein with two distinct functions.

CAREER

   Dr. Gadsby received his bachelor's degree in 1969 and his master's in
   1973, both in physiology and biophysics from the University of
   Cambridge, where he attended Trinity College. He graduated with a Ph.D.
   in physiology from University College London in 1978. Dr. Gadsby came
   to Rockefeller in 1975 to study with Paul F. Cranefield in the
   Laboratory of Cardiac Physiology. He was promoted to assistant
   professor in 1978, associate professor in 1984 and professor in 1991.

   Dr. Gadsby received a MERIT Award from the National Institutes of
   Health in 1998, the K.S. Cole Award from the Biophysical Society in
   1995 and an Irma T. Hirschl Career Scientist Award in 1986. In 2005, he
   was elected a fellow of The Royal Society.

   Dr. Gadsby is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
