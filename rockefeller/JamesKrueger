Faculty Bio

   James Krueger

   Psoriasis, which is caused when the body's immune system attacks the
   skin, is one of the most accessible human diseases in which to examine
   both cellular and molecular pathogenesis of T cell mediated
   autoimmunity. Dr. Krueger uses histological and genomic approaches to
   study psoriasis as a model Th17 inflammatory disease. His work has
   implications for other common T cell mediated inflammatory diseases,
   including rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, which
   have similar immunological phenotypes.

   Dr. Krueger's group focuses on the study of cutaneous inflammation and
   autoimmune mechanisms in human skin. Their research is fundamentally
   rooted in "bench-to-bedside" science, combining the clinical study of
   new medical therapeutics with laboratory study of relevant
   immunopathogenic mechanisms in human cells and tissues. The Krueger
   laboratory conducts clinical research on patients with psoriasis
   vulgaris within The Rockefeller University Hospital. They treat
   patients with a wide variety of engineered immune agonists or
   antagonists in order to stimulate or inhibit molecular control points
   for the restoration of normal immune responses. By combining novel
   immune-directed therapeutics with large-scale study of gene expression
   (using gene chips and real-time RT-PCR reactions), an approach called
   pharmacogenetics, they seek to elucidate the molecular pathways that
   cause pathogenic inflammation and regulate normal human immune
   responses.

   More experimental immunotherapeutics have been assessed in clinical
   studies in psoriasis than any other human inflammatory disease. Dr.
   Krueger's group has pioneered a number of successful treatments,
   including some that act on T cells, one that antagonizes specific
   inflammatory cytokines and one that utilizes a type of ultraviolet
   light with immunomodulatory properties.

   The lab-based research accompanying Dr. Krueger's clinical trials
   includes the study of T cell, dendritic cell and keratinocyte
   activation responses using techniques such as cell culture, flow
   cytometry and biochemical analysis. His group is also studying
   expression of a defined set of proinflammatory genes through real-time
   PCR and many other genes through genome-wide statement studies using
   DNA arrays. They defined the first disease classification set for
   psoriasis using chip-based approaches and recently determined a
   specific genetic and immunological signature that differentiates
   psoriasis from the closely related skin disorder called atopic eczema.

   Dr. Krueger's research in healthy skin showed that a previously unknown
   population of dendritic cells exists alongside macrophages in the skin.
   Other recent work by members of the Krueger lab showed that a newly
   discovered immune cell, Th17, plays a central role in psoriasis and
   could serve as a target for future therapies. And by investigating the
   contribution of activated T lymphocytes, Dr. Krueger has found that
   psoriasis may be induced by tissue-infiltrating T lymphocytes, which
   trigger keratinocytes into a physiologically regulated wound repair
   pathway of hyperplasia and altered differentiation.

   In order to place inflammatory pathways discovered in psoriasis in the
   context of other T cell mediated diseases and tissue rejection
   responses, the team has been collaborating with investigators of other
   inflammatory cutaneous diseases (e.g., atopic dermatitis, sarcoidosis
   and autoimmune alopecia) and graft-versus-host disease. They are
   attempting to define molecular pathways that control normal and
   pathogenic cellular immune responses in order to broaden our
   understanding of organ-specific autoimmune diseases.

CAREER

   Dr. Krueger received his bachelor's degree from Princeton University in
   1979, his Ph.D. from The Rockefeller University in 1984 and his M.D.
   from Cornell University Medical College in 1985. He came to Rockefeller
   as a guest investigator in the Laboratory for Investigative
   Dermatology, was appointed assistant professor in 1990, associate
   professor and head of lab in 1995 and professor in 2003. Dr. Krueger
   has held positions at The Rockefeller University Hospital since 1989.
   In 2006 he became codirector of the Center for Clinical and
   Translational Science, established by a Clinical and Translational
   Science Award from the National Center for Research Resources of the
   National Institutes of Health. Dr. Krueger was medical director and
   program director of the General Clinical Research Center from 1996 to
   2006 and currently directs the Milstein Medical Research Program, which
   conducts new clinical studies of the pathogenesis of melanoma and other
   pigmentory diseases.

   In 2010 Dr. Krueger won the Astellas Award in Public Health from the
   American Academy of Dermatology as well as the Farber Award from the
   Society of Investigative Dermatology. In 2006 Dr. Krueger received the
   E.H. Ahrens Jr. Award for clinical research from the Association for
   Patient-Oriented Research. He is also a recipient of two awards from
   the American Skin Association: the Distinguished Achievement Award and
   the Psoriasis Research Achievement Award, both granted in 2001. Dr.
   Krueger is a member of the American Society for Clinical Investigation
   and the Association of American Physicians.

   Dr. Krueger is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
