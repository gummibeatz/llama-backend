   Alexander Tomasz

   Many symptoms of bacterial disease can be traced to molecular events at
   the surface of the invading bacteria. A bacterium's cell wall is also
   the target of antibiotics designed to interrupt its replication. But
   with antibiotic resistance, bacteria acquire or modify genetic
   determinants to remodel the replication machinery so that it withstands
   disruption. Thus, several issues of microbiology, medicine,
   chemotherapy and infectious disease converge in the structure and
   molecular biology of the bacterial cell wall.
   Dr. Tomasz's laboratory uses biochemistry and molecular genetics in
   combination with firsthand medical knowledge to study three basic
   problems: how the bacterial cell wall is assembled and replicated; how
   bacteria respond to antibiotic treatment and ultimately gain
   resistance; and how bacteria cause human disease. Dr. Tomasz's work
   focuses on Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, two
   major human pathogens that frequently cause community- and
   hospital-acquired disease. Multidrug-resistant clones of these two
   pathogens have acquired global spread.

   Cell walls may be envisioned as vast networks of covalent bonds
   organized into macromolecular sheets with the shape and size of the
   entire bacterial cell. How these "super" molecules are reproduced with
   precision in every cell division as often as every 20 minutes is one of
   the most intriguing questions of microbial cell biology. Using
   conditional mutants of key cell wall biosynthetic genes, the Tomasz lab
   aims to identify genetic determinants and protein catalysts involved
   with this morphogenetic process.

   Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem. Treatment of S. pneumoniae
   and S. aureus with penicillins or glycopeptide antibiotics triggers a
   suicidal process -- a kind of programmed cell death -- in the bacteria
   that leads to the killing and dissolution of the cells. A special
   mechanism named "antibiotic tolerance," which enables bacterial cells
   to evade this intriguing suicidal pathway, was discovered in the Tomasz
   lab in the mid-1970s.

   Tolerant bacteria survive the antibiotic but are still inhibited by it.
   Antibiotic-resistant bacteria can overcome even the inhibitory effects
   of these agents. In the mid-1990s, the Tomasz lab was the first to
   demonstrate that penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae involves the
   reengineering of the structure of a family of proteins, named
   penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), so as to reduce their affinity for
   the antibiotic. The genetic program for this reengineering involves the
   import of blocks of foreign DNA by pneumococci, which then use them to
   alter genetic determinants of its PBPs and change their affinity for
   the antibiotic. In the late 1960s, the Tomasz lab identified a critical
   component of this DNA uptake mechanism: pneumococci secrete a
   polypeptide that induces the expression of proteins to allow foreign
   DNA to pass through its walls. This hormone-like substance was the
   first of numerous "quorum-sensing" factors that have since been
   identified in many microbial phenomena. Pneumococci with the
   reengineered PBPs are not only resistant to penicillin but also show an
   altered chemical structure of their cell walls.

   All methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains carry a foreign gene called
   mecA, which is the critical component of the resistance mechanism.
   Recent data from the Tomasz lab strongly suggest that the evolutionary
   source of mecA is a cell wall synthetic gene ubiquitous in all isolates
   of the animal commensal species Staphylococcus sciuri.

   Using whole genome sequencing, the Tomasz lab was recently able to
   identify specific mutations that accompanied the evolution of
   antibiotic resistance in an S. aureus strain recovered from the
   bloodstream of a patient undergoing extensive chemotherapy by
   vancomycin.

   To understand how bacteria cause disease, the Tomasz lab is
   investigating alterations in the chemical structure of the cell wall
   that can have a profound impact on bacterial virulence. For instance,
   mutants of S. pneumoniae that produce a cell wall lacking phosphoryl
   choline residues suffer a profound loss in virulence.

   The Tomasz lab is also using molecular fingerprinting to track the
   spread of antibiotic-resistant clones of staphylococci and pneumococci.
   Many of these investigations are done in collaboration with other labs
   in Europe and South America.

CAREER

   Dr. Tomasz, a native of Hungary, earned his Ph.D. in biochemistry from
   Columbia University in 1963 and joined Rollin D. Hotchkiss's
   Rockefeller laboratory as a postdoc. He became assistant professor in
   1964, associate professor in 1967 and professor and head of laboratory
   in 1973.

   In 1998 Dr. Tomasz was named to an endowed chair in infectious diseases
   honoring the late Greek microbiologist Plutarch Papamarkou. In 1987 he
   received the Selman A. Waksman Award in Microbiology. In 1982 he
   received the first Hoechst-Roussel Award in antimicrobial chemotherapy
   from the American Society for Microbiology.

   Dr. Tomasz is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
