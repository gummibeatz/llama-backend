   Vincent Fischetti

   Infections by gram-positive bacteria are a major cause of morbidity and
   mortality worldwide. The Fischetti lab is working to understand the
   earliest events that occur when gram-positive bacteria interact with
   human tissues and cause disease. His research is aimed at developing
   strategies to interfere with these events, such as vaccines to induce a
   mucosal immune response, and using phage lytic enzymes to both remove
   colonizing pathogenic bacteria to prevent infection and treat
   established infections.

   Dr. Fischetti works with gram-positive bacteria, such as streptococci
   and staphylococci, organisms that do not contain a second cell membrane
   outside of the cell wall. In the fight against infectious disease, Dr.
   Fischetti develops unique treatment strategies to prevent infection.
   His approach involves novel anti-infectives and exploring the use of
   phage lytic enzymes to remove pathogenic bacteria from infected
   tissues.

   Dr. Fischetti's lab uses recombinantly produced phage lysins that will
   kill the major gram-positive pathogens -- Streptococcus pyogenes,
   Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis
   and Bacillus anthracis -- and has used these enzymes to destroy their
   respective bacteria in animal models of disease. The enzymes are
   extremely potent; microgram quantities are needed to destroy millions
   of organisms within seconds of contact. They are also highly specific
   and unlike antibiotics, only kill the disease-causing bacteria without
   harming the beneficial bacteria. Dr. Fischetti's studies have shown
   that when small amounts of the phage lysins are administered to mice
   that have intentionally been infected with these bacteria, the
   disease-causing bacteria are rapidly destroyed. In an animal model of
   pneumococcus pneumonia, Dr. Fischetti and his collaborators have shown
   that systemic administration of the phage enzyme Cpl-1 can rescue mice
   infected with the pathogen and completely reverse lung tissue damage if
   given within 24 hours postinfection. Dr. Fischetti and his colleagues
   showed that when the enzyme is delivered to the brains of mice with
   pneumococcal meningitis, it effectively removes the organisms from the
   site. The lab has also shown that by removing colonizing S. pneumoniae
   from the nose of mice, they could completely prevent secondary ear
   infections triggered by influenza. This lysin technology has been
   licensed and is expected to proceed to human trials.

   Using lytic enzymes as a tool, Dr. Fischetti's lab developed a method
   of drilling through the thick cell walls of gram-positive bacteria
   while keeping them intact. The technique enabled the Fischetti lab to
   access the bacterial cytoplasm with labeled antibodies to study
   intracellular molecules that were previously inaccessible.

   As new antibiotics are proving futile against resistant strains of
   bacteria, the Fischetti lab has developed a method to identify novel
   targets in bacterial cells that have proven to produce
   "resistance-proof" antibiotics. The approach exploits the billion-year
   association of bacteriophage and bacteria, in which bacteriophages have
   identified weak points in bacteria that can be exploited for antibiotic
   development. Using this approach, the Fischetti lab has identified a
   novel target, the enzyme 2-epimerase, in the biosynthetic pathway for
   cell wall biosynthesis that is critical for bacterial survival. A novel
   inhibitor based on this target, Epimerox, was found to protect animals
   from lethal infection, and when bacteria were tested for resistance to
   Epimerox, none could be found (the frequency of resistance was less
   than 10^-11).

   To infect their host, bacteria use their surface molecules to attach
   and invade human tissues, particularly those that line the nose and
   throat. Knowledge of the process bacteria use to anchor these molecules
   in their cell walls could lead to strategies to prevent infection. The
   M protein is a surface protein that is the major virulence factor of
   group A streptococci because of its ability to impede attack by human
   white blood cells. Analysis of this molecule by Dr. Fischetti's lab
   shows that the region used to attach the M protein to the streptococcal
   cell surface is highly conserved in all gram-positive bacteria,
   indicating that the mechanism for anchoring surface proteins in
   bacteria is also conserved. Since bacteria cannot cause infection
   without their surface proteins, a molecule that blocks surface protein
   attachment will be broadly applicable to different gram-positive
   bacteria.

CAREER

   Dr. Fischetti grew up in New York City, receiving his B.S. in
   bacteriology from Wagner College in 1962 and his M.S. in microbiology
   from Long Island University in 1967. He received his Ph.D. in
   microbiology from New York University in 1970. Dr. Fischetti came to
   Rockefeller as a postdoc in 1970 and became assistant professor in
   1973, associate professor in 1978 and professor in 1990. In 1987 Dr.
   Fischetti received a 10-year National Institutes of Health MERIT Award
   that was renewed in 1997.

   Dr. Fischetti is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
