   Sebastian Klinge

   Ribosomes, molecular machines that catalyze protein synthesis in cells,
   must be able to accurately and completely translate messenger RNA into
   synthesized proteins that function in all domains of life. Dr. Klinge
   is interested in the structure and function of the proteins required
   for the assembly of the eukaryotic ribosome.

   Ribosomes are giant molecular machines that are responsible for
   decoding the information contained in messenger RNA to synthesize
   proteins in all domains of life. Ribosome maturation, the process by
   which ribosomes are synthesized, is a very complex process, which
   involves approximately 200 factors in eukaryotes, of which most are
   essential for viability. These factors are involved in all stages of
   ribosome maturation, from transcription of ribosomal RNA in the
   nucleolus to export into the cytoplasm, where final stages of
   maturation occur. Our knowledge of the molecular machinery responsible
   for ribosome maturation is currently limited by a lack of structural
   information. Although work on the prokaryotic ribosome has advanced
   with structural studies of several important functional complexes,
   there had until recently been no atomic-level structural information
   about corresponding eukaryotic subunits. In contrast to their
   prokaryotic homologues, eukaryotic ribosomes are substantially larger,
   and this increase in size is accompanied by an overall increase in
   complexity.

   As a postdoc, Dr. Klinge solved the 3.5-Ångström crystal structure of
   the Tetrahymena thermophila 60S ribosomal subunit, the first atomic
   description of any large eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. The structure
   illustrates the complex functional architecture of the eukaryotic 60S
   subunit, which comprises an intricate network of interactions between
   eukaryote-specific ribosomal protein features and RNA expansion
   segments. Eukaryote-specific elements cluster in two regions of the
   solvent-exposed side. In contrast to the prokaryotic 50S subunit, in
   which ribosomal proteins are isolated entities, the 60S ribosomal
   proteins are largely interconnected, giving rise to an intricate
   network of interactions. Eukaryote-specific proteins frequently fulfill
   key structural roles by interacting with RNA expansion segments. The
   structure further reveals the roles of eukaryotic ribosomal protein
   elements in the stabilization of the active site, since proteins in the
   vicinity of the catalytic center form an interconnected module.

   At Rockefeller, Dr. Klinge works to solve the structures of
   macromolecular assemblies that catalyze key steps of ribosome
   maturation in eukaryotes. Structural information about these assemblies
   will represent a structural framework to understand the function of the
   complexes, and it will further provide a cornerstone for subsequent
   biochemical analysis.

   Ultimately, Dr. Klinge hopes to reconstitute the initial stages of
   ribosome biogenesis in vitro. Such a system would facilitate the
   mechanistic study of different processing steps and allow for the
   isolation of specific intermediates, which cannot be obtained in vivo
   and may therefore provide novel approaches to study ribosome
   biogenesis.

CAREER

   Dr. Klinge, a native of Germany, received his B.A. and Ph.D. in
   biochemistry from the University of Cambridge in 2005 and 2009,
   respectively. He was a postdoc in Nenad Ban's laboratory at ETH Zurich
   in Switzerland from 2009 to 2013. He came to Rockefeller as assistant
   professor in 2013.

   Dr. Klinge has been the recipient of fellowships from the Bill &
   Melinda Gates Foundation, the European Molecular Biology Organization
   and the Human Frontier Science Program. In 2014 Dr. Klinge was named a
   Human Frontier Science Program Career Development Awardee, an Alfred P.
   Sloan Research Scholar, an Irma T. Hirschl/Monique Weill-Caulier Trusts
   Research Awardee and a Rita Allen Foundation Scholar.

   Dr. Klinge is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program, the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program and
   the Tri-Institutional Ph.D. Program in Chemical Biology.
