Faculty Bio

   Daniel Mucida

   Dr. Mucida studies how the immune system associated with intestinal
   mucosae is able to generate efficient immune responses without
   jeopardizing its tolerance to innocuous antigens, and what happens when
   this balance is disrupted.

   The human intestinal mucosae, which have a surface area of about 300
   square meters, form the body's largest surface that is exposed to
   exogenous antigens. The intestines absorb approximately 100 grams of
   dietary proteins each day and are also home to an estimated 100
   trillion commensal bacteria, about 10 times the number of cells of the
   human body. To mediate immunity over such a large and active area,
   there are more lymphocytes associated with the intestine than there are
   in the entire rest of the human body.

   Most intestinal lymphocytes display an activated phenotype, yet under
   normal physiological conditions they remain in an immune quiescent
   state. This so-called "gut physiological inflammation" is maintained by
   distinct regulatory mechanisms, including regulatory lymphocytes and
   dendritic cells. The Mucida laboratory works on understanding how the
   immune system is regulated in intestinal mucosa and how it maintains a
   balance between efficient immune response and tolerance to innocuous
   antigens.

   One of the goals of his laboratory is to characterize the cellular and
   molecular mechanisms that lead to the development of pro-inflammatory
   and regulatory cells at the mucosal surfaces, both from the innate and
   the adaptive immune system. Dr. Mucida has shown that the intestine is
   able to efficiently induce regulatory lymphocytes that can prevent
   allergy and other inflammatory processes and that diet provides
   precursors that can be used for the maintenance of intestinal
   homeostasis. He has found that a vitamin A metabolite, retinoic acid,
   produced by intestinal dendritic cells, is able to modulate the
   development of inflammatory and regulatory cells.

   A second interest of Dr. Mucida's lab is to understand how exposure to
   different classes of commensal bacteria affects the development and
   differentiation of immune cells and susceptibility to inflammatory
   processes. The crucial role of the microbiota for the development and
   maturation of the immune system is demonstrated by studies on germ-free
   animals, which bear an immature immune system. However, not only the
   number but also the type of bacteria can differentially influence
   immune responses, with some classes of bacteria inhibiting while other
   classes induce inflammatory cells. Dr. Mucida has found that commensal
   bacteria are a crucial factor involved in the modulation of
   inflammatory cells in the intestine. Although CD4 helper T cells are
   crucial for the generation of efficient immune responses, uncontrolled
   CD4 helper T cells can pose a threat to an organism, particularly in
   chronically stimulated sites such as the mucosal surfaces. In
   conventionally raised mice, but not in germ-free mice, the intestinal
   environment efficiently suppresses CD4 helper T cell inflammatory
   activity and redirects CD4 T cells to become CD8-like cytotoxic T
   cells.

   The Mucida laboratory also uses several animal models to study
   intestinal and systemic infections to dissect the molecular and
   cellular pathways triggered by infectious agents and how they can be
   modulated to achieve protective, but not destructive, immune responses.
   Although the great majority of antigenic sources in the mucosal
   surfaces are nondeleterious, the intestine is also a major site of
   entry for viruses, pathogenic bacteria, fungi and parasites. The
   requirement for a rapid and efficient immune protection, however,
   contrasts with the possibility of unregulated or excessive immune
   responses toward gut antigens, which can lead to allergies and severe
   inflammatory bowel diseases.

CAREER

   Dr. Mucida received his undergraduate degree in biology, with an
   emphasis on biochemistry and immunology, from the Federal University of
   Minas Gerais in Brazil in 2000. He received his Ph.D. jointly from the
   University of São Paulo and New York University in 2005. After
   postdoctoral studies at the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and
   Immunology from 2006 to 2010, he joined The Rockefeller University as
   assistant professor in 2010.

   Dr. Mucida has received 2007 and 2008 fellowship awards from the
   Diabetes and Immune Disease National Research Institute, 2009 and 2012
   career development awards from the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of
   America, a 2011 New Scholar Award on Aging from the Ellison Foundation
   and the 2012 Research Award from the Irma T. Hirschl/Monique
   Weill-Caulier Trusts.

   Dr. Mucida is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
