   Thomas Tuschl

   RNA is not only a carrier of genetic information; it is also a catalyst
   and can function as a guide in protein complexes processing or
   regulating other RNA molecules. Dr. Tuschl is investigating different
   gene regulatory mechanisms that are triggered by doublestranded RNA and
   RNA-binding proteins in mostly human cells, with the goal of developing
   a new generation of therapeutic treatments for genetic diseases.

   Dr. Tuschl molecularly characterized small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), a
   class of double-stranded molecules 21 nucleotides long that guide
   sequence-specific gene silencing, and was the first to demonstrate
   their utility in knocking down human gene expression. These siRNAs are
   processed from longer double-stranded RNA precursors and assemble into
   effector complexes that destabilize messenger RNAs partially or fully
   complementary to one of the siRNA strands. Eukaryotic cells express a
   variety of classes of small RNAs to control gene expression. The Tuschl
   lab identified these classes and their many members using specialized
   cloning techniques. The most important classes represent microRNAs and
   piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs).

   microRNAs are made from larger RNA precursors containing about 30 base
   pair stem-loops. These microRNAs are involved in many biological
   processes and are even expressed in viruses -- in particular, members
   of the herpesvirus family -- by controlling messenger RNA stability and
   translation of hundreds of messenger RNA targets. piRNAs are
   specifically expressed in male and female germ line cells and are
   required for normal germ cell development. Although researchers know
   that knocking out the piwi genes in mice causes male infertility, the
   targets and molecular function of piRNAs remain unknown. Efforts to
   characterize their biogenesis and targets are ongoing but are hampered
   by the lack of cell lines expressing piRNAs.

   In a global effort to clarify the role of RNAs in development and in
   various diseases, the Tuschl lab continues to catalogue and annotate
   all cellular RNAs, including conventional noncoding RNAs and messenger
   RNA isoforms. RNAs have been difficult to detect and measure in
   archival tissue sections using traditional histological techniques. The
   Tuschl lab continues to develop new fluorescence-based methods to
   visualize RNA molecules in distinct subcellular compartments and
   granules to assess their displacement observed in neurodegenerative and
   inflammatory diseases. The work will help researchers better understand
   the roles of regulatory RNAs and possibly defective RNA biogenesis
   processes in the onset of disease.

   In a broader perspective, messenger RNAs interact during their life
   cycle in a sequence-specific manner with a large number of small
   RNA-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) as well as directly
   RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). In order to understand these regulatory
   networks, the Tuschl lab has developed experimental approaches to
   precisely define the binding sites of RBPs and RNPs on messenger RNAs
   and their precursors. Current studies focus on characterizing RBPs
   where mutations are known causes of genetic diseases, such as fragile X
   mental retardation and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The
   identification of their messenger RNA targets shed light on their
   function and may lead to the design of new therapeutic agents.

CAREER

   Dr. Tuschl received his Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of
   Regensburg, in Germany, in 1995. He went to the Max Planck Institute
   for Experimental Medicine in GoÅNttingen, Germany, pursuing research
   with Fritz Eckstein. He next joined the biology department at the
   Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Whitehead Institute for
   Biomedical Research, where he worked with Phillip A. Sharp and David P.
   Bartel. Dr. Tuschl was a junior investigator at the Max Planck
   Institute for Biophysical Chemistry before coming to Rockefeller in
   2003 as associate professor. He was named professor in 2009. Since
   2005, he is also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.

   Dr. Tuschl is a member of the German National Academy of Sciences
   Leopoldina, and his most recent honors include a 2012 NIH Director's
   Transformative Research Project Award, the Ernst Jung Prize for
   Medicine in 2008 and the Max Delbrück Medal and the Karl Heinz Beckurtz
   Award in 2007. In 2006 he received the Molecular Bioanalytics Prize
   from Roche Diagnostics. In 2005 he was named a fellow of the New York
   Academy of Sciences and received the Meyenburg Prize, the Irma T.
   Hirschl Trust Career Scientist Award and the Ernst Schering Award. In
   2003 he received the Wiley Prize in Biomedical Sciences, the New York
   City Mayor's Award for Excellence in Science and Technology and the
   Newcomb Cleveland Prize from the American Association for the
   Advancement of Science. Dr. Tuschl was the recipient of the European
   Molecular Biology Organization Young Investigator Award in 2001.
