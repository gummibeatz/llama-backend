   Mitchell Feigenbaum

   The description and prediction of natural events that exhibit erratic
   behavior, such as whorls in fluids, remain challenges in physics and
   mathematics. Dr. Feigenbaum's laboratory helped establish the field of
   chaotic dynamics, which seeks the understanding of just such phenomena.
   Its overall thrust is to enlarge the applicability of mathematics to
   science.

   Dr. Feigenbaum is a pioneer in the science of "chaos," the mathematics
   of erratic dynamical systems -- objects with unpredictable behavior and
   an attendant "fractal" geometry.

   Chaotic motion shows a lack of predictability despite the total absence
   of any random ingredients. While the various constraints on a system,
   such as bounded resources, can allow it to move regularly on a smooth
   space, its chaotic motion lies in a highly complicated subspace -- a
   so-called "strange attractor." Using computers and inventing
   mathematics, Dr. Feigenbaum erected a full, precise mathematical
   description of systems during their transition from order to disorder
   -- for example, a dripping faucet changing from a steady drip into an
   erratic one. The mathematics that underlies this changeover holds true
   for all systems undergoing this "period doubling" onset of chaos, with
   all scaling details identically independent of a system's precise
   nature, including fluctuating animal populations, electrical signals in
   circuits, lasers and various chemical reactions. Dr. Feigenbaum has
   shown that all these phenomena prominently exhibit numbers determined
   by his theory, for example 4.6692016..., a constant of nature called
   "Feigenbaum's constant," determining the rate of onset.

   A fractal is a complex object built hierarchically of finer and finer
   details, all similar apart from their successively reduced scales.
   These intricate formations in space, reminiscent of objects such as
   mountains and snowflakes, as well as complex formations in time, can be
   described by mathematical rules, discovered by Dr. Feigenbaum, called
   "scaling functions." Scaling functions describe the evolution of an
   object, whatever its current form or size, and so, unchanged,  can be
   repeatedly reapplied.

   In this circumstance, the object produced is scale invariant, meaning
   that as it evolves from a given size, its details remain loosely
   proportional to that size, and so, fractal. Looking at systems from
   this perspective, Dr. Feigenbaum has made important contributions to
   numerous fields, including cartography: As a consultant to the Hammond
   Corporation, he developed techniques that allow computers to draw maps
   of archival quality, with unprecedented accuracy, using a dataset of
   just one high, fixed resolution. This atlas, published in 1992,
   contains Dr. Feigenbaum's "optimal" conformal projections for
   arbitrarily chosen regions on Earth, and these projections are at least
   three times more accurate than all previous ones. The
   computer-automated labeling of maps was also accomplished by a new
   directed-annealing algorithm for dynamical systems.

   During his time at Rockefeller, Dr. Feigenbaum has taken part in
   numerous collaborations, including research into the electrical
   fluctuations of single neurons to quantitatively determine their
   chaotic properties; measuring the way fibroblasts travel to the site of
   injury, observing that as their path appears not to be random, they are
   moving chaotically; and analyses of the outcome of optical imaging of
   cortical activity.

CAREER

   Dr. Feigenbaum received his Ph.D. in theoretical high-energy physics
   from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1970, under Francis
   E. Low. He was a research associate at Cornell University  from 1970 to
   1972 and a research associate at Virginia Polytechnic Institute from
   1972 to 1974. He then moved to Los Alamos National Laboratory, where he
   was a staff member from 1974 to 1981 and a fellow from 1981 to 1982.
   (Dr. Feigenbaum, while creating his work on chaos, shared his office
   with Murray Gell-Mann in 1976.) From 1982 to 1986 he was a professor of
   physics at Cornell University. Dr. Feigenbaum was a visiting member at
   the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, in 1978 and
   1984. He joined The Rockefeller University in 1986. In addition to
   being the university's Toyota Professor, he is also director of the
   Center for Studies in Physics and Biology.

   Among many awards, Dr. Feigenbaum received the 2008 Dannie Heineman
   Prize for Mathematical Physics for developing the theory of
   deterministic chaos and a 2005 New York City Mayor's Award for
   Excellence in Science and Technology for his pioneering studies in
   chaos theory. In 1986 he was awarded Israel's top scientific honor, the
   Wolf Foundation Prize in Physics. He was presented with a John D. and
   Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 1984, the Ernest O.
   Lawrence Award by the United States Department of Energy in 1982 and
   the Los Alamos National Laboratory's Distinguished Performance Award in
   1980. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in
   1987 and the National Academy of Sciences in 1988.

   Dr. Feigenbaum is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
