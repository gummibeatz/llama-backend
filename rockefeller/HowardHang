   Howard Hang

   Microbial pathogens have evolved sophisticated virulence mechanisms to
   subvert host defenses and cause disease. Dr. Hang is interested in
   developing chemical tools to understand how microbes evade host immune
   responses and identifying chemical inhibitors targeted at virulence
   pathways to combat microbial infections.

   Microbial pathogens have evolved sophisticated virulence mechanisms to
   subvert host defenses and cause disease. Dr. Hang's laboratory is
   interested in understanding how microbes evade host immune responses
   and in developing chemical inhibitors targeted at virulence pathways to
   combat microbial infections.

   As host membranes provide a key physical barrier for infection,
   bacterial pathogens and viruses often utilize complex mechanisms to
   remodel cellular membranes to enter host cells and cause disease.
   Understanding host-pathogen interactions at the membrane interface may
   therefore provide new opportunities to prevent infections. To dissect
   the mechanisms by which microbial pathogens manipulate host membranes,
   the Hang laboratory has developed specific lipid chemical reporters and
   bioorthogonal labeling methods to robustly visualize and identify novel
   lipid-modified and membrane-associated proteins that are crucial for
   host resistance to infection. In particular, chemical proteomics and
   functional studies from the Hang laboratory have revealed that protein
   lipidation mechanisms (S-palmitoylation and S-prenylation) can control
   the membrane targeting and activity of several proteins involved in
   host immunity, including interferon-stimulated effectors such as IFITM3
   and innate immunity receptors. These studies suggest that protein
   lipidation mechanisms can regulate the strength and specificity of host
   immune responses and highlight lipid modifications and metabolism as
   potential cellular pathways for pathogen interference during infection.
   To further understand the mechanistic and functional roles of these
   lipid-modified immune effectors and receptors in host immunity and
   infection, the Hang laboratory is currently performing in vitro
   reconstitution studies of these immune proteins and evaluating their
   activity in cellular and animal models of infection. In addition to
   lipid chemical reporters, the Hang laboratory has also developed
   chemical reporters for other protein modifications (acetylation,
   AMPylation and ADP-ribosylation) to explore their functional roles in
   host defense and microbial pathogenesis.

   To limit infections from microbial pathogens, the Hang laboratory is
   interested in developing chemical inhibitors of key microbial virulence
   pathways and characterizing their mechanisms of action. Notably, the
   injection of bacterial protein effectors into host cells through type
   III secretion systems is essential for the virulence of many
   gram-negative bacterial pathogens, which make these secretion systems
   prime targets for the development of anti-virulence inhibitors. To
   identify potent small-molecule inhibitors of this crucial bacterial
   virulence pathway, the Hang laboratory has developed a high throughput
   assay for type III protein secretion and discovered specific small
   molecules from medicinal plants and synthetic libraries that can
   antagonize them and inhibit bacterial infection. These inhibitors are
   not broadly bactericidal and provide new lead compounds for selectively
   targeting bacterial pathogens responsible for disease without
   perturbing the beneficial host microbiota.

CAREER

   Dr. Hang received his undergraduate degree in chemistry from the
   University of California, Santa Cruz, in 1998 and his Ph.D. in
   chemistry from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2003. He was
   a Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation postdoctoral fellow at
   Harvard Medical School and the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical
   Research. He joined Rockefeller in 2007 as assistant professor and head
   of laboratory and was appointed associate professor in 2013.

   Dr. Hang has received the Irma T. Hirschl/Monique Weill-Caulier Trusts
   Research Award in 2007 and an Ellison Medical Foundation New Scholar
   Award in Aging in 2008.

   Dr. Hang is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program, the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program and
   the Tri-Institutional Ph.D. Program in Chemical Biology.
