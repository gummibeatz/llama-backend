Faculty Bio

   Frederick Cross

   Cell cycle control involves the precisely coordinated production and
   destruction of numerous proteins that activate cell cycle events in
   cells from yeast to human beings. The regulation of these events has
   central significance to diseases including cancer, which results when
   cells divide without restraint, having ignored certain cell division
   checkpoints. The tight regulation of cell cycle control also is
   critical to the process of cell differentiation.

   Using budding yeast as a model system, Dr. Cross uses both genetic and
   biochemical approaches to investigate the molecular basis of cell cycle
   control. He is looking to understand how critical regulatory proteins
   called cyclins control cell cycle progression, both through their
   timely degradation and through their ability to be highly selective of
   the molecules with which they interact. Other areas of study in the
   Cross lab are devoted to the development of mathematical models that
   represent control of the cell cycle and to the creation of single-cell
   imaging methods for regulation of gene expression and protein
   localization through the cell cycle. Members of his lab are also
   investigating the regulation and activity of a specific phosphatase,
   Cdc14, that counteracts cyclin activity during mitosis. The laboratory
   is interested in systematic approaches to cell cycle control, including
   mathematical modeling.

   A recently initiated project concerns cell cycle control in the green
   alga Chlamydomonas, which is a good microbial genetic model for the
   plant superkingdom. Plant genetics is challenging because of long
   generation times, diploid genetics and ancient polyploidizations that
   result in many genes being present in multiple functional copies,
   masking loss-of-function phenotypes. Chlamydomonas, with essentially a
   full plant genome with respect to core cell biology including cell
   cycle regulation, has almost all of its genes in single copy, is
   haploid, and is amenable to classic microbial genetics as well as
   modern molecular methods. The lab plans to create a systematic
   collection of mutations in all genes involved in Chlamydomonas cell
   cycle control in order to begin focused studies on similarities and
   differences in eukaryotic cell cycle control across kingdoms.

   Cell cycle control is of central concern in a number of diseases,
   including cancer, which results when certain cell division checkpoints
   are ignored and the cells divide without restraint. In other cells,
   such as stem cells, cell cycle control is even more tightly regulated
   and is critical to the process by which cell differentiation occurs.
   Dr. Cross's studies are likely to have ramifications for both of these
   areas.

CAREER

   Dr. Cross received his undergraduate degree in biology from Swarthmore
   College in 1978 and his Ph.D. in viral oncology from The Rockefeller
   University in 1984. He was a postdoc in the department of genetics at
   the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle from 1985 to
   1989, in the laboratory of the late Harold Weintraub, before returning
   to Rockefeller in 1989 as assistant professor. He became associate
   professor in 1993 and professor in 1995.

   Dr. Cross was a Lucille P. Markey Scholar from 1988 to 1992. He was a
   Helen Hay Whitney Postdoctoral Fellow from 1985 to 1988 and a National
   Science Foundation Predoctoral Fellow from 1978 to 1981.

   Dr. Cross is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
