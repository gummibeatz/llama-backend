   The use of GIS, remote sensing and modeling to explore spatial and
   temporal variability in ecosystems

   Research

   My current research is focused on the spatial dynamics of Lyme disease
   and other tick-borne pathogens in two different ecosystems.

   Spatial dynamics of ticks and tick-borne diseases in Dutchess County,
   NY
   In Dutchess County, an area where Lyme disease is endemic, we are
   interested in the spatial distribution of the black-legged tick, Ixodes
   scapularis, and potential environmental correlates. Additionally, we
   are studying the effects of host communities on Lyme disease and
   Anaplasmosis.

   Sudden Oak Death and Lyme disease in northern California
   Forest communities in northern California are being altered by Sudden
   Oak Death. The change in forest species composition and the creation of
   canopy gaps may affect the western black-legged tick, Ixodes pacificus,
   and their hosts. We are studying how tick and host populations are
   influenced by Sudden Oak Death and the resulting affects on Lyme
   disease risk.
