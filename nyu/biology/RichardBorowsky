   Research

   The Cave Biology Research Group concentrates on the molecular evolution
   and genetics of cave fishes. Current projects include genomic mapping
   of the QTL (quantitative trait loci) responsible for developmental
   changes in eyes, pigmentation and metabolism in Astyanax cave fish from
   Mexico and molecular phylogenetic studies of the balitorid cave fishes
   of SE Asia. The laboratory also engages in an active program of field
   research, with current efforts in Thailand, Mexico and Brazil.

   Teaching
   The main teaching activity is the coordination of the undergraduate
   Principles of Biology course.
