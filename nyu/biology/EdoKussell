   Classical studies of molecular biology revealed how cells sense their
   environment and respond to change, establishing the centrality of gene
   regulation in cellular physiology. Numerous mechanisms in bacteria,
   however, function in a largely deregulated way, generating a diversity
   of responses across the population, without necessarily sensing the
   environment. The existence of such stochastic mechanisms raises several
   (increasingly difficult) questions: (1) How do microorganisms employ
   stochasticity to their advantage? (2) Can we distinguish such adaptive
   stochasticity from useless noise that is simply too costly for cells to
   avoid? (3) How, and under what circumstances, do sensing mechanisms
   evolve? My research employs theoretical and computational modeling of
   bacteria populations in fluctuating environments, and comparative
   genomics of experimentally-characterized stochastic switches.

   Closely related topics of research include the evolution of mutation
   rates, mutator phenotypes, and mutational hotspots in genomes. My other
   interests include protein folding and protein evolution.

   I received my Ph.D in Biophysics from Harvard University, where I
   worked with Eugene Shakhnovich on physical aspects of protein folding,
   including relaxation dynamics and packing of protein sidechains,
   high-resolution Monte Carlo simulation of folding, and theory related
   to protein evolution. I went on to do post-doctoral work with Stanislas
   Leibler at The Rockefeller University where, starting with simple
   models of antibiotic persistence in E. coli, we worked towards
   understanding in some generality the evolutionary advantage of
   stochastic phenotype switches in microorganisms. We eventually found
   that these mechanisms are intimately connected with information
   acquisition in a general sense, and that in certain cases the
   evolutionary advantage of phenotype switching can be expressed in
   purely information theoretic terms. I joined the NYU faculty in the
   Department of Biology in September 2006, where I am working on theory
   and modeling of evolution in microorganisms.
