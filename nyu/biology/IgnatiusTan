   Research

   My research interests focus on gap junctions which are involved in
   cell-to-cell communication. Regulating the chemical and physical
   properties of gap junctions are the different connexin proteins. Unique
   communication compartments can be formed when gap junctions are
   assembled from various connexins.

   Presently, I am examining the implications of gap junctions on cell
   differentiation and development using the testis as a model. Organized
   in the seminiferous tubule and supported by Sertoli cells are some 63
   different germ cell types. The germ cells are arranged and organized in
   the seminiferous epithelium for an ordered development and
   differentiation into spermatozoa. We are currently determining gap
   junctionâs role in the formation of specific communication compartments
   and how gap junctions regulate and support specific spermatogenic
   cells. Gap junction assembly, connexin composition, and the chemical
   and physical properties of homotypic - heterotypic gap junctions will
   be examined biochemically and ultrastructurally.

   Electron Microscope and Image Analysis Facility:

   The facility has a confocal microscope and three electron microscopes:
   two TEM's and a SEM. Support equipment include ultramicrotomes,
   paraffin micotome, high vacuum evaporator, sputter coater, critical
   point dryer, and a low temperature UV chamber for immuno EM. The two
   modern EMâs are capable of high resolution imaging and capturing
   digital images. The SEM supports elemental image mapping/analysis and
   imaging of frozen samples.

   Transmission Electron Microscopes:

   Phillips E-300
   Phillips CM-10. Scanning Electron Microscopes: AMRAY 1850-FE with
   secondary, Robinson backscatter, and EDX detectors and cryo-chamber

   Confocal Microscope System:

   Leica TCS SP2 confocal system for available inverted and upright
   microscopes.
   Image analysis workstation.
