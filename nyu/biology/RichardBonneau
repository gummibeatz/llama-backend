   Dr. Bonneau focuses on two main categories of computational biology:
   learning networks from functional genomics data and predicting and
   designing protein and peptoid structure. In both areas he has played
   key roles in achieving critical field-wide milestones. In the area of
   structure prediction he was one of the early authors on the Rosetta
   code, which was one of the first codes to demonstrate accurate and
   comprehensive ability to predict protein structure in the absence of
   sequence homology. His lab has also made key contributions to the areas
   of genomics data analysis. They focus on two main areas: 1) methods for
   network inference that learn dynamics and topology from data (the
   Inferelator) , and 2) methods that learn condition dependent
   co-regulated groups from integrations of different genomics data-types
   (integrative biclustering). His lab strives to develop new methods that
   let systems-biologists derive functional forms from relevant biology
   and parameters from data automatically. Dr. Bonneau has also helped to
   start a new project with political scientists and experimental
   psychologists to apply methods for learning network structure from time
   series to social media time series data (using Twitter, online blogs
   about politics, and Facebook as our initial data sources (recently
   funded by NSF INSPIRE, http://smapp.nyu.edu/ ).
