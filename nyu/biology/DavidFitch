   Evolution of development, molecular systematics, and developmental
   genetics of the male tail in nematodes related to C. elegans.

   Using the developmental genetic model system Caenorhabditis elegans, we
   are characterizing genes responsible for morphogenesis, a collection of
   fundamental developmental mechanisms that shape and organize cells into
   particular forms. C. elegans is used for this study because it is
   complex enough to share components and mechanisms of more complex
   multicellular animals, but is simple enough to be described in complete
   terms. The structure we are using as a model for morphogenesis is the
   sexually dimorphic tail tip. This simple feature is constructed of only
   4 cells that, in males only, fuse very late in juvenile ("larval")
   development and change their cellular structure and position. This
   results in a blunt shape (the pointy shape of the hermaphrodite tail
   results from lack of morphogenetic change). We've finished a complete
   transmission electron microscopic reconstruction of these cellular
   events using serial sections, providing a descriptive foundation for
   further functional studies. We have isolated several mutations that
   fail at certain steps of male tail tip morphogenesis, and are currently
   cloning the genes defined by these mutations to understand their
   molecular functions.

   Evolutionary changes in the development of the tail tip have also
   occurred. Using molecular phylogenetic analysis in combination with a
   developmental genetic approach, we are reconstructing the developmental
   changes that have occurred in male tails during the evolution of family
   Rhabditidae (of which C. elegans is a member). So far we have found
   several mutations that closely mimic evolutionary changes, suggesting
   candidate genes that could have been involved in evolutionary changes.
   These investigations will provide specific information about the genes
   and processes conserved in morphogenetic mechanisms as well as insight
   into the ways that these mechanisms can change to produce variation in
   multicellular form.
