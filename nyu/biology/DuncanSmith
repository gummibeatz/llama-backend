   Broadly, we are interested in the mechanism and consequences of
   asymmetric DNA replication

   As a consequence of the antiparallel arrangement of the two strands of
   the double helix and the 5'-3' polarity of DNA polymerases, DNA
   replication is intrinsically asymmetric. Only one parental strand at
   the replication fork can be continuously replicated: the other â the
   lagging strand â is discontinuously synthesized via the iterative
   generation, processing and ligation of Okazaki fragments to generate an
   intact daughter strand. In each S-phase, mammalian cells generate
   around 20 million Okazaki fragments: we are interested in the molecular
   mechanisms underlying this remarkable process, as well as the various
   potential consequences of the asymmetric mechanism by which DNA is
   replicated.

   Lagging-strand synthesis requires a coordinated sequence of several
   enzymatic activities (Fig. 1). Each Okazaki fragment is (i) initiated
   by Pol alpha/primase and (ii) subsequently extended by DNA polymerase
   delta (Pol delta); the 5â end of the preceding fragment is (iii)
   displaced by ongoing Pol delta synthesis and degraded by one of several
   nucleases; finally, (iv) DNA ligase joins the fragment to the nascent
   daughter strand. My lab is working on several broad questions related
   to the regulation and coordination of lagging-strand synthesis, which
   we investigate using a combined genetic, biochemical and genomic
   approach, generally in the model yeast S. cerevisiae but with
   occasional forays into more exotic territory.
