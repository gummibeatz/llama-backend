   In the Carlton lab, we use the tools of comparative genomics â whole
   genome sequencing and genomics, bioinformatics, molecular biology and
   population genetics â to study the biology and evolution of closely
   related strains or species of parasite. In medicine and global public
   health, the term parasite is used to describe a group of eukaryotic
   microbes and helminths that cause some of the worldâs most devastating
   diseases. The parasites that we study include:

   (1) Species of the malaria parasite Plasmodium: more than half the
   worldâs population is at risk from malaria, and the disease causes ~216
   million cases and ~655,000 deaths per year. The most deadly form of the
   parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, is found mostly in sub-Saharan Africa
   where it causes the deaths of children < 5 years old. Plasmodium vivax
   is the most common species outside Africa in South America and
   Southeast Asia, and is closely related to a group of species that
   infect Asian Old World monkeys from Taiwan to Sri Lanka, called the
   monkey malaria clade.

   (2) The sexually transmitted parasite Trichomonas vaginalis and related
   trichomonads: T. vaginalis is the most common non-viral STI, and causes
   ~249 million cases per year world-wide. It is associated with increased
   risk of HIV-1 infection, and serious complications during pregnancy.
   Other trichomonads include Trichomonas tenax found in the mouth,
   Pentatrichomonas hominis a zoonotic gut parasite, and Tritrichomonas
   foetus a serious venereal pathogen that causes abortion in cattle.

   (3) Other fascinating parasites such as species of the enteric pathogen
   Cryptosporidium, the bovine parasite Theileria, and Babesia.

   Our research often begins with generation of a resource such as
   sequencing, assembly and annotation of a parasiteâs genome. For
   example, we have been involved in the sequencing of P. falciparum [1],
   species of rodent malaria (Plasmodium yoelii yoelii [2], Plasmodium
   chabaudi chabaudi and Plasmodium berghei [3]), several strains of P.
   vivax [4, 5], several strains of the monkey malaria Plasmodium
   cynomolgi [6], and the first T. vaginalis genome [7].

   Sequencing the genome of a parasite enables the complete gene and
   protein repertoire to be identified and provides a wealth of data about
   the basic biology of that organism, leading to hypothesis-driven
   studies. Generating sequences of multiple strains or species enables
   studies of whole genome evolution, genetic diversity and population
   genetics/genomics. Some of the research areas that members of the
   Carlton lab undertake in these areas include:

   Since many of the parasites we work on are important global public
   health problems in lower and middle income countries as well as poor
   regions of the United States, we collaborate with researchers and
   clinicians who work in public health clinics in order to move our
   research from the bench to the field. Some examples of our
   collaborations include:
