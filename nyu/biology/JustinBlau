   How genes control animal behavior is the big question my lab is
   interested in. We mainly study circadian (~24hr) rhythms of behavior,
   arguably the best understood behavior at molecular and cellular levels.
   We use the fruitfly Drosophila as a powerful model system that has led
   the way in circadian rhythm research and is ideal for analyzing
   behavior at the level of single genes, single neurons, neuronal
   networks and whole animal behavior. We use Genetics, Genomics &
   BioInformatics, Microscopy and Behavioral assays to build a holistic
   model of how flies anticipate daily environmental changes.

   Adult flies have 24hr rhythms in their activity: they are more active
   by day, especially at dusk and dawn, and rest by night â paralleling
   human sleep/wake cycles. These rhythms persist in constant darkness,
   indicating that flies have an internal sense of time. Forward genetics
   helped identify a set of core clock genes that are essential for 24hr
   rhythms in constant darkness, and these genes work together in
   transcription / translation feedback loops, forming "molecular clocks".

   A recent technical breakthrough we made has allowed us to obtain whole
   genome expression profiles from the master pacemaker neurons (LNvs) at
   different times of day. These datasets are helping us understand the
   biology of these neurons by giving us insights into how LNvs control
   the timing of their output signals, novel signaling pathways involved
   in circadian rhythms and a system-level understanding of how LNv gene
   expression is altered in different electrical states.

   The larval clock neurons form a âminimalâ circadian neural network with
   many fewer neurons than adult flies. We have been using this simplified
   circadian system to understand how clock neurons communicate to keep
   their molecular clocks synchronized with each other and to generate
   rhythmic behavior. The expectation is that what we learn in Drosophila
   will hold true for mammalian pacemaker neurons. Other projects ongoing
   in the lab include developing a novel decision-making paradigm in
   Drosophila.

   I graduated from Cambridge University with a BA in Natural Sciences in
   1991 where my time in Mike Bateâs lab sparked my appreciation for
   Drosophila. For my Ph.D., I worked with David Bentley at ICRF in
   London, studying the basic mechanisms of how transcription factors
   stimulate RNA polymerase II to activate gene expression using mammalian
   cell culture. I decided to work on a larger and more open question
   while a postdoc, and joined Mike Young's laboratory in 1996 at The
   Rockefeller University in New York to study circadian rhythms in
   Drosophila. I joined the faculty here at NYU as an Assistant Professor
   in 2000 and was awarded tenure in 2006 and promoted to Professor in
   2013.
