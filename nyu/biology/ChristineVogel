   My research revolves around proteins, their properties, evolution, and
   expression patterns. I am a systems biologist who uses statistical and
   computational tools, large-scale quantitative mass spectrometry, and
   molecular biology techniques to study the dynamics of the cellular
   proteome.

   Quantitative shotgun proteomics

   fig1.png Until recently, it was impossible to accurately estimate the
   absolute and relative concentrations of thousands of proteins in
   complex biological samples. Our quantitative proteomics technology
   called APEX (Absolute Protein Expression Index, Nature Biotech, 2007
   25(1)) allows us to do so â for everything from bacteria to yeast and
   human. Mass spectrometry data is highly complex, and we continuously
   improve our data mining methods with respect to the identification and
   quantification of proteins. For example, in MSpresso and MSnet
   (Bioinformatics 2009a, b), we use mRNA expression data and protein
   functional network information, respectively, to increase the number of
   proteins that were identified by mass spectrometry analysis.

   The dynamics of protein expression

   The expression levels of proteins are determined by transcription,
   translation, mRNA and protein stability, and these processes are
   regulated by a plethora of mechanisms. Thus, the relationship between
   protein and mRNA expression levels varies across organisms and sets of
   proteins (Mol BioSystems, 2009 5(12)). Using yeast and human cell
   lines, we characterize the proteome and transcriptome under normal
   conditions and in response to stimuli. Time course data allows us to
   describe cellular processes as dynamical systems and will enable us to
   better understand protein expression regulation â both mathematically
   and biologically.

   Proteomics characterization of translation regulators

   The human genome encodes ~600 proteins with RNA-binding domains, and
   many of these proteins are putative translation regulators. Using
   quantitative proteomics approaches and complementary molecular biology
   techniques, we characterize the impact of RNA-binding proteins on the
   'translation regulatory network'. One example is Musashi-1 which is a
   key regulator involved in brain tumor formation, and we analyze its
   impact on the human proteome and transcriptome. This project is carried
   out in collaboration with Luiz Penalva (UTexas San Antonio).
