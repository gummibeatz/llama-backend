   Developmental and evolutionary genomics of plants. The origin and
   genetic programming of cell types.

   The research in my lab focuses on two inter-related questions: How do
   multi-cellular organisms construct specialized cells and how do the
   genetic components of specialized cells change over evolutionary
   scales? The goal is to better understand how gene regulatory networks
   orchestrate cell maturation, a process that results in a set of highly
   specialized cell types. Thus, we focus on cellular differentiation,
   which is one of the key steps in organ formation and development in
   higher organisms. The approach of the lab combines genomics and
   molecular genetic tools. For example, we have pioneered a new technique
   to isolate cell types in plants using high-speed fluidics. From there,
   RNA from a specific cell type population is applied to microarrays to
   provide a profile of gene activity at the transcriptional level.
   Transcriptional profiles of cells can then be used to identify likely
   cell-specific regulators and infer properties of the genetic circuitry
   of cellular specification.

   Two experimental approaches are being used to address this larger
   question. The first project is large-scale reverse genetics guided by a
   detailed map of gene expression in the root and other organs. As a case
   study in cellular development, we have started to analyze knockouts of
   genes that are highly enriched in xylem, which are the water-conducting
   cells of the plant's vascular system. We also use computational
   approaches to generate testable hypotheses on the targets of
   transcription factors that control xylem maturation. The second project
   is creating detailed maps of gene expression in the roots of other
   plant species, such as rice. This will help us to track changes in gene
   expression during evolution. We can then ask how genetic networks have
   changed over time to create new cellular attributes and, occasionally,
   new cell types.
