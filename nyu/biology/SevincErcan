   Having an extra or missing a copy of a chromosome is detrimental for
   normal cells. Despite this, X chromosome exists in different copy
   numbers in males (XY) and females (XX), thus presenting a significant
   biological challenge. In many animals, this challenge is met by protein
   complexes that equalize X-chromosome transcript levels between males
   and females. These complexes are called the âdosage compensation
   complexesâ, and are targeted specifically to the X chromosome and alter
   chromatin structure to regulate transcription. We study C. elegans
   dosage compensation as a model to understand chromosome-wide regulation
   of chromatin structure and transcription. Our research is currently
   focused on two questions:
