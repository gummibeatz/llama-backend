   Research

   Our laboratory focuses on two major developmental questions: The
   evolution of early embryonic development and the establishment of
   retinal and brain circuitry that underlies color vision. These distinct
   systems represent paradigms for understanding how pattern formation is
   genetically controlled.

   * The first project is an Evo-Devo approach to the earliest steps of
   insect development, the formation of the antero-posterior embryonic
   axis. In flies, the morphogenetic gradient of the Bicoid protein is
   essential for anterior development. However, bicoid is not conserved
   and is a newly evolved gene that has taken over the ancestral function.
   We are using the wasp Nasonia as an alternate model system to study how
   a very distant species patterns its axis. Nasonia is a Hymenoptera that
   diverged from Diptera over [fig_1.jpg] 200MY ago but exhibits a long
   germband mode of development similar to flies. The genome of Nasonia is
   sequenced and there are early developmental mutants and parental RNAi
   to address gene function. We have shown that Nasonia, like flies,
   utilizes an anterior morphogenetic center to generate the patterning
   information required for the formation of all segments but uses
   localized otd instead of bcd mRNA. Our ongoing investigations attempt
   to understand the entire segmentation pattern in Nasonia, with the goal
   of reaching the same level of mechanistic detail as in Drosophila.

   * The other system that we study is the determination of the retinal
   mosaic that underlies color vision in flies. Color vision is achieved
   through the comparison in the brain of inputs coming from
   photoreceptors containing rhodopsins with different wavelength
   specificity. Different rhodopsins are expressed in stochastic but
   mutually [fig_2.jpg] exclusive patterns in the compound eye of
   Drosophila as in cones of the vertebrate retina. A given rhodopsin gene
   is stochastically chosen, leading to repression of all others. Another
   mechanism must then inform the brain of its connection to a
   photoreceptor with a given color sensitivity. We have used molecular
   and genetic approaches to decipher the genetic network that controls
   the specification of the 8 types of photoreceptors that form the
   retinal mosaic.

   * Visual information is processed in the optic lobes. Two types of
   photoreceptors mediate motion detection or color discrimination by
   projecting to lamina (motion) or medulla (color) parts of the optic
   lobes. We focus our attention on the medulla that contains a finite
   number of neurons and serves as a paradigm to understand the
   development and function of a sophisticated neural structure. We have
   defined 70 medulla cell types: projection neurons, local interneurons,
   columnar neurons (that contact photoreceptors from each unit eye), and
   non-columnar neurons (that contact termini from several unit eyes).
   These neurons form overlapping retinotopic maps before projecting to
   the lobula complex or back to the lamina. We study how medulla neuron
   diversity is generated and how these neurons establish their
   retinotopic connections to photoreceptors. Neuronal specification
   appears to result from the integration of three mechanisms: (i)
   Neuroblasts sequentially acquire distinct identity and produce unique
   neuronal types as they age; (ii) binary fate induction via Notch
   diversifies their daughter cells (iii) regionalization of the medulla
   modifies the neuroblast program for further neuronal diversity. We use
   this knowledge together with electrophysiology and behavior assays to
   investigate how neuronal types function in the motion and chromatic
   pathways.
