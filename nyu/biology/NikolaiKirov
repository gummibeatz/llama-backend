   Gene function and mechanisms of gene regulation during Drosophila
   development.

   List of Publications from Pubmed

   My research interests are in the area of gene regulation during
   embryonic development. I am studying the signal transduction pathway
   initiated by member of the TGF-Ã superfamily Dpp in Drosophila
   melanogaster. Early in the development it acts as a morphogen similarly
   to activins and BMPs in vertebrate embryos. It controls the cell fates
   along the dorsal-ventral axis of the embryo and anterior-posterior
   patterning of the adult appendages in a concentration dependent manner
   by eliciting differential transcriptional response from its target
   genes. Using molecular, biochemical and genetic analysis I am currently
   studying the promoter elements of Dpp terget genes and searching for
   coactivators and corepressors involved in their regulation. We are also
   investigating the mechanism of negative regulation of Dpp target genes
   by the gene brinker with a goal to uncover the general principles
   governing gene response to the embryonic morphogens.

   I teach Molecular Biology Lab I and II graduate courses. These are
   experimental classes, which cover a broad array of molecular biology
   techniques.
