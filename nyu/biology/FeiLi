   epigenetics, epigenomics, chromatin

   Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in phenotype that occur
   without changes in DNA sequence. Epigenetic mechanisms are essential
   for many cellular processes, such as gene-expression regulation, genome
   organization and cell-fate determination. Defects in epigenetic
   regulation have been implicated in a variety of diseases, including
   cancer. The aim of our research is to understand the fundamental
   principles of epigenetic regulation. Toward this goal, we have chosen
   to study the fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), a model
   eukaryotic organism well suited to a combination of powerful
   experimental approaches, including genetics, cell biology, biochemistry
   and genomics. Importantly, fission yeast contains many conserved
   epigenetic components, and has thus emerged as a premier model for
   epigenetic study.

   Epigenetic Regulation of Heterochromatin
   In eukaryotes, DNA is packaged together with histone proteins into an
   ordered, highly complex chromatin structure. Chromatin exists in two
   forms: euchromatin and heterochromatin. Euchromatin is typically
   transcriptionally active and loosely packaged, whereas heterochromatin
   is gene-poor and appears highly compact throughout the cell cycle.
   Heterochromatin is a classic example of epigenetic phenomena and plays
   an important role in gene regulation, chromosome segregation and genome
   stability. Taking advantage of powerful genetic and biochemical
   approaches available in fission yeast, we have identified multiple key
   heterochromatin factors. We aim to understand the epigenetic mechanisms
   that regulate establishment and maintenance of heterochromatin.

   Epigenetic Regulation of Centromeres
   Centromeres are specific chromosomal loci where the kinetochore, a
   multiprotein complex, is assembled. Kinetochores mediate attachment of
   spindle microtubules to centromeres, ensuring proper segregation of
   chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis. A fundamental question in
   biology is how centromere identity is defined and maintained through
   generations. In most eukaryotes, centromere assembly and propagation
   are regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. Centromere Protein-A (CENP-A),
   a centromere-specific histone 3 variant, represents the most likely
   candidate for the epigenetic mark that specifies centromere identity.
   CENP-A provides a structural and functional foundation for the assembly
   of kinetochores. Defects in the regulation of CENP-A are catastrophic
   for cells and result in chromosome mis-segregation and aneuploidy, or
   an abnormal number of chromosomes, the hallmark of human cancers. We
   are currently using biochemical, genetic, cytological and genomic
   approaches to dissect the gene regulatory network mediating the
   faithful inheritance of centromeres.
