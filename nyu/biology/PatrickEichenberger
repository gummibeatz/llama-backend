   Comparative and functional genomics of endospore-forming bacteria.

   Bacillus subtilis is a non-pathogenic soil bacterium and the prevalent
   model organism for all low GC Gram-positive bacteria. When B. subtilis
   cells are starved, they initiate a developmental program that
   culminates in the formation of highly resistant endospores (also
   referred to as spores). Endospore formation (sporulation) constitutes a
   relatively simple developmental system in which the generation of
   distinct cell types can be investigated experimentally. In previous
   work in the laboratory of Prof. Richard Losick at Harvard University,
   we have used a variety of genomics techniques to identify most, if not
   all, of the genes that are specifically turned on during the process of
   sporulation in B. subtilis. However, the function of many of these
   newly-identified genes remains undetermined.

   1. B. subtilis spore coat composition and assembly during sporulation

   In my laboratory, our characterization of newly-identified sporulation
   genes focuses on genes involved in the formation of the outermost
   structure of the mature spore: the spore coat. The coat is a
   proteinaceous shell surrounding the spore. It confers resistance to
   various chemicals and is required to maintain the structural integrity
   of the spore to avoid spontaneous spore germination. More than 30
   different coat proteins had been previously characterized in B.
   subtilis from classical genetic screens. In order to identify the
   complete repertoire of genes encoding coat proteins, we have performed
   a systematic program of gfp fusions to the sporulation genes that were
   identified in our transcriptional profiling experiments. The
   subcellular localization of all of the resulting protein fusions was
   investigated and as a result, 24 novel coat proteins have been
   identified. These fusions localize as rings or polar caps around the
   maturing forespore. We are also expressing all of the newly-generated
   fusions in cells mutant for genes involved in spore coat assembly. In
   parallel, we have observed by time-course microscopy that several of
   the novel coat proteins display dynamic patterns of spore coat
   localization. We would like to determine how these proteins affect
   subcellular localization of other coat proteins. The ultimate goal is
   to obtain a detailed assembly map of the entire developing spore coat.
