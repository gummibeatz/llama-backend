   Evolutionary and ecological genomics of plant adaptations

   We study the evolutionary forces that act in plant developmental
   networks at the species level, and in mapping and isolating genes that
   underlie natural variation in that are responsible for plant
   adaptation. We are also interested in exploring the âecological
   transciptomeâ â the dynamic gene networks found in plants in ecological
   environments. This work combines concepts and techniques in
   evolutionary and quantitative genomics, developmental biology,
   evolutionary ecology, and computational biology.

   Genetics of Plant Domestication

   Crops are plant species that have evolved in a cultural context to
   provide food and other products for human society. Crop species are
   fascinating subjects for evolutionary study, since they are examples of
   species that have undergone rapid diversification under intense
   selection pressures. They also permit us to understand the dynamic
   interface between genetics, evolution and human culture. We are
   studying the evolution of genes in rice (Oryza sativa). By using tools
   of molecular and evolutionary genomics, these studies provide insights
   into the processes and mechanisms that accompany cultural selection on
   plant species during domestication events.

   The Evolution of Multicellularity and Social Behaviour

   The model protist Dictyostelium discoideum has been a model for the
   study of social biology as well as the evolution of multicellularity.
   We are integrating techniques and approaches in population genetics,
   genomics, systems biology and glycomics to study kin discrimination and
   recognition in this social microbe.

   Work in my laboratory is funded by grants from the NSF Plant Genome
   Research program and the Population and Evolutionary Processes program.

   Dr. Michael Purugganan received his B.S. in Chemistry from the
   University of the Philippines (1985), an M.A. from Columbia University
   (1986) and a Ph.D. in Botany with a Global Policy minor at the
   University of Georgia (1993). After obtaining his Ph.D., he did
   postdoctoral research as an Alfred P. Sloan Molecular Evolution Fellow
   at the University of California in San Diego, studying the evolution of
   development (1993-1995). Dr. Purugganan is a leader in the field of
   evolutionary and ecological genomics and his work focuses on
   identifying the molecular basis for evolutionary adaptations that occur
   in nature. Prior to joining the NYU faculty in 2006, he was the William
   Neal Reynolds Distinguished Professor of Genetics at North Carolina
   State University, where he also won the Outstanding Faculty Research
   Award and the Sigma Xi Research Prize. He is the recipient of an Alfred
   P. Sloan Foundation Young Investigator Award, a Guggenheim Fellowship,
   is a Kavli Fellow, and in 2005 was elected a Fellow of the American
   Association for the Advancement of Science. Dr. Purugganan is on the
   editorial boards of the journals Genome Biology and Evolution,
   Molecular Ecology, Trends in Plant Science and the Annual Review of
   Ecology, Evolution and Systematics.
