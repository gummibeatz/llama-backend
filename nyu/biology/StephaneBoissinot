   Professor Stéphane Boissinot is an evolutionary biologist who uses a
   combination of field-based, molecular and computational approaches to
   address fundamental biological questions. He has done research on a
   diversity of topics, including the evolution of genome size and
   structure, the evolution of innate resistance to viral infection and
   the biogeography of East African vertebrates. He received his Ph.D.
   from the University of Montpellier (France) on the evolution of the
   house mouse. He then held post-doctoral positions at the University of
   Texas where he studied the evolution of color vision in primates and at
   the National Institutes of Health where he worked on the evolution of
   mobile DNA elements in human.

   He was Professor of Biology in the Department of Biology at Queens
   College, the City University of New York, from 2003 to 2014. He joined
   NYU Abu Dhabi in the spring 2015.
