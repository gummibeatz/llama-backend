We\n', '   use genetic, biochemical, and genomic approaches to study gene\n', '   regulatory networks in the early Drosophila embryo. Initially the\n', '   embryo relies on maternally deposited gene products to begin\n', '   developing, and the transition to reliance on its own zygotic-gene\n', '   activity is called the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). The MZT\n', '   represents a major cellular reprogramming event whereby thousands of\n', '   maternal RNAs are degraded and hundreds of new zygotic RNAs are\n', '   transcribed during the time between egg fertilization and blastoderm\n', '   formation. Recently we discovered a key transcriptional regulator\n', '   called Zelda, which plays a key role in this reprogramming event. Our\n', '   goal is to understand how Zelda mediates the rapid and robust\n', '   activation of the zygotic genome and how it works together with the\n', '   other key transcription factors to prepare the embryo for major\n', '   developmental processes such as gastrulation and tissue\n', '   differentiation.\n', '\n', '   Currently, the major project in the lab aims to understand how Zelda\n', '   functions at the mechanistic level. Zelda is a zinc-finger\n', '   transcription factor, and binds to CAGGTAG and related sites (Liang et\n', '   al., 2008). Interestingly, our genome-wide binding analysis\n', '   (ChIP-chip/seq) showed that Zelda binds to known enhancers in the early\n', '   embryo to such an extent that Zelda binding is a predictive indicator\n', '   of the location of an enhancer (Nien et al., 2012). Zelda is the major\n', '   hub in the early gene network (Liang et al., 2008; Nien et al., 2011).\n', '   Zelda binds enhancers well before the gene is activated (Harrision et\n', '   al., 2012; Nien et al., 2010), suggesting that Zelda might act as a\n', '   pioneer factor, a special class of transcription factors that bind\n', '   target sites in chromatin, allowing other factors access to enhancers\n', '   (reviewed in Zaret and Carroll, 2011). In this way, Zelda may\n', '   potentiate the activity of other transcription factors such as the\n', '   patterning morphogens, an exciting hypothesis that points to the\n', '   significance of Zelda function in embryonic patterning. We believe that\n', '   Zelda works together with morphogens, and though we do not yet know how\n', '   they interact, one fact is clear - that without Zelda, morphogens\n', '   cannot function to their full potential, particularly when at low\n', '   concentrations, and target genes are not activated at the right time\n', '   and in the right place. Mechanistically, Zelda may act as a beacon on\n', '   chromatin for other transcription factors. Without Zelda, these factors\n', '   may not position correctly, and redistribute to other regions of the\n', '   genome. In collaboration with the Zeitlinger lab at Stowers Institute,\n', '   we are examining the chromatin landscape in wild type and zelda mutant\n', '   embryos to determine how Zelda cooperates with other key regulators\n', '   during the MZT.\n', '\n', '   A second Zelda project stems from the observation that Zelda is\n', '   expressed in older embryos and larva, specifically in imaginal discs\n', '   and the brain. For example in the eye disc and optic lobe of the brain,\n', '   Zelda is expressed in the undifferentiated cells and is down-regulated\n', '   upon differentiation. In the opitc lobe neuroepithelium, which\n', '   comprises stem cells that give rise to neuroblasts/neurons, loss of\n', '   Zelda causes premature differentiation. We propose that Zelda\n', '   establishes the neural stem cell gene network, which prepares cells for\n', '   the neuropeithelial to neuroblast transition.\n', '\n', '   The projects in the my lab require the use of several types of\n', '   approaches from manipulating genes and transgenes and observing the\n', '   output phenotypes, to systems/genome-wide studies that require\n', '   bioinformatic analysis. We also collaborate with systems biologist Stas\n', '   Shvartsman, who models Zelda interactions with the patterning\n', '   morphogens. Together these approaches will allow an understanding of\n', '   how global factors like Zelda interact with key regulators to control\n', '   robust expression of the early zygotic genome.\n', '\n', '   I teach the undergraduate Genetics course.

However, the\n', '   subtype identity is rarely controlled during ESC directed\n', '   differentiation or cellular programming. Therefore, successful in vitro\n', '   differentiation protocols to be applied either for cell based therapies\n', '   or disease modeling should produce neurons with defined generic and\n', '   subtype identity. During in vivo and in vitro differentiation, members\n', '   of the Hox family of transcription factors impose subtype identity and\n', '   control motor neuron (MN) connectivity. Thus, understanding how Hox\n', '   genes interact and synergize with MN resident factors to control\n', '   subtype identity is the key to manipulating MN identity. Based on\n', '   phenotypic characterization, expression analysis and ChIP-seq of Hox\n', '   genes during in vitro MN differentiation, we plan to identify the\n', '   enhancer structure at Hox binding sites and to establish the minimal\n', '   set of cofactors and molecular logic required for Hox gene activity in\n', '   MNs.

The aim of our research is to understand the fundamental\n', '   principles of epigenetic regulation.

Chromatin exists in two\n', '   forms: euchromatin and heterochromatin. Euchromatin is typically\n', '   transcriptionally active and loosely packaged, whereas heterochromatin\n', '   is gene-poor and appears highly compact throughout the cell cycle.\n', '   Heterochromatin is a classic example of epigenetic phenomena and plays\n', '   an important role in gene regulation, chromosome segregation and genome\n', '   stability. Taking advantage of powerful genetic and biochemical\n', '   approaches available in fission yeast, we have identified multiple key\n', '   heterochromatin factors.

Kinetochores mediate attachment of\n', '   spindle microtubules to centromeres, ensuring proper segregation of\n', '   chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis. A fundamental question in\n', '   biology is how centromere identity is defined and maintained through\n', '   generations. In most eukaryotes, centromere assembly and propagation\n', '   are regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. Centromere Protein-A (CENP-A),\n', '   a centromere-specific histone 3 variant, represents the most likely\n', '   candidate for the epigenetic mark that specifies centromere identity.\n', '   CENP-A provides a structural and functional foundation for the assembly\n', '   of kinetochores.

Dr.\n', '   Libchaber applies a type of mathematics called nonlinear dynamics to\n', '   biological systems in order to understand how an object and its\n', '   surrounding environment act on one another to provide a specific\n', '   result.\n', '\n', '   Dr. Libchaber studies mathematical patterns in biology at the\n', '   organismal, cellular and molecular levels. At the organismal level, his\n', '   work examines the interactions and dynamics between organism and\n', '   environment, including the effects of moving boundary conditions on\n', '   fluid flow. A moving fish, for example, involves a complicated\n', '   interaction of a dynamic object with the surrounding fluid, with forces\n', '   by both elements acting on one another. In the lab, Dr. Libchaber, in\n', "   collaboration with researchers at New York University's Courant\n", '   Institute of Mathematical Sciences, studied a system of flexible\n', '   filaments in a flowing soap film, which mimics a fish moving in water.\n', '   Working with Escherichia coli bacteria, Dr. Libchaber has recently\n', '   shown how temperature and oxygen gradients as well as bacterial\n', "   concentrations finely tune and control the bacteria's motility and\n", "   genetics. The research firmly established that an organism's\n", '   environment affects its genes and behavior.\n', '\n', "   Dr. Libchaber's lab has also undertaken a series of experiments at the\n", '   single-molecule level to define the minimal conditions needed to\n', '   produce an artificial cell. Within a phospholipid vesicle, which mimics\n', '   a cell membrane, Dr. Libchaber places DNA containing the necessary\n', '   genes and their regulatory sequences. This cell, which is in contact\n', '   with a feeding solution through its semipermeable membrane, is then the\n', '   environment for testing different gene networks and elementary logic\n', "   circuits for their ability to reproduce essential events in a cell's\n", "   life, such as producing proteins and transporting them to the cell's\n", '   surface. The research may hold clues to the origin of life, and the\n', '   ultimate aim is to produce an artificial cell that self-reproduces\n', '   following a genetic program.\n', '\n', '   Another important concept concerning the origin of life is the\n', '   development of a genetic code that relates the 20-amino acid world to\n', '   the four-nucleotide one. Dr. Libchaber has recently shown that an RNA\n', '   molecule of a stem-loop structure, acting as a ribozyme, can load an\n', "   amino acid to its 3' end. This amino acid corresponds to the anticodon\n", '   in the loop, and this whole process can be done without enzymes.\n', '\n', "   Past research in Dr. Libchaber's lab has elucidated the effects of\n", '   temperature on DNA. In a detailed study on the effects of\n', '   thermophoresis on DNA in solution, they found that when far infrared\n', '   lights are focused on the center of a chamber, DNA within the chamber\n', '   moves from a hot region to a cold one. As the heat is increased,\n', '   however, convection sets in and causes the opposite: The DNA collects\n', '   and accumulates in the bottom center of the chamber. Because this\n', '   phenomenon could be used to sustain very high concentrations of DNA or\n', '   proteins, it sheds light on how critical concentrations of DNA may have\n', '   been reached amid early primordial-soup chain reactions and therefore\n', '   played an important role in early life forms. Then the laboratory\n', '   showed that polymerase chain reaction, DNA amplification, is\n', '   essentially a thermal convection process.\n', '\n', 'CAREER\n', '\n', '   Born in Paris, Dr. Libchaber received his undergraduate degree in\n', '   mathematics from the University of Paris in 1956.

The Tarakhovsky lab studies the\n', '   mechanisms by which pathogens affect chromatin function and how they\n', '   affect long-lasting immune and nonimmune cell responses to the\n', '   environment.\n', '\n', '   Organism response to environmental stresses has both a predetermined,\n', '   as well as an adaptive, nature. The predetermined response reflects the\n', '   cell type-specific differences in signaling pathways and gene\n', '   expression programs. In turn, adaptive responses reflect the ability of\n', '   individual cells within a given lineage to integrate distinct\n', '   environmental cues and to respond to them in a well-calibrated fashion.\n', '   The predetermined and adaptive responses depend largely on tightly\n', '   controlled gene expression programs that operate within limits imposed\n', '   by a gene-specific chromatin environment. In the immune system, changes\n', '   in chromatin are associated with, and contribute to, differentiation of\n', '   hematopoietic stem cells into highly diverse immune cell\n', '   subpopulations. Cell type-specific programs that drive responses of\n', '   differentiated immune cells to pathogens differ significantly between B\n', '   and T lineage cells as well as between cells of the adaptive and innate\n', '   immune systems. The Tarakhovsky laboratory studies the mechanisms by\n', '   which pathogens affect the function of chromatin, as well as how they\n', '   affect long-lasting immune and nonimmune cell responses to the\n', '   environment.\n', '\n', '   Several years ago, the Tarakhovsky laboratory proposed the "histone\n', '   mimicry" paradigm as a novel mechanism for regulation of gene\n', '   expression. According to this paradigm, regulation of gene expression\n', '   could be controlled by histone-like entities present in nonhistone\n', '   proteins that can compete with histones for the regulators of gene\n', '   expression. The foundation of this model originates from identification\n', '   of the histone mimic within the histone methyltransferase G9a, which\n', '   plays the important role of gene silencing. Further studies show the\n', '   presence of histone mimics in a large number of human and mouse\n', '   proteins. Furthermore, the laboratory found that pathogenic\n', '   microorganisms carry histone mimics in the proteins that critically\n', '   contribute to pathogen-mediated suppression of the host immune\n', '   response. This finding led them to propose a mechanism according to\n', '   which histone mimics in bacterial and viral proteins may serve as\n', '   histone surrogates, thus hijacking chromatin-based pathways of immune\n', '   response. The histone mimics concept led the Tarakhovsky laboratory to\n', '   develop synthetic histone mimics that regulate inflammatory gene\n', '   expression by interfering with association between histones and\n', '   transcription regulators. In the future, the laboratory plans to extend\n', '   its research toward an understanding of the mechanism of epigenetic\n', '   conditioning of host cells by pathogens. This research may help to\n', '   elucidate the basis of chronic inflammatory disorders that are\n', '   initiated by infection but can persist in the absence of infectious\n', '   agents.\n', '\n', 'CAREER\n', '\n', '   Dr. Tarakhovsky received his medical degree from the Kiev Medical\n', '   Institute in the Ukraine in 1978 and his Ph.D. from the Institute for\n', '   Oncology at the Academy of Science in Kiev in 1982.

A bacterium's cell wall is also\n", '   the target of antibiotics designed to interrupt its replication. But\n', '   with antibiotic resistance, bacteria acquire or modify genetic\n', '   determinants to remodel the replication machinery so that it withstands\n', '   disruption. Thus, several issues of microbiology, medicine,\n', '   chemotherapy and infectious disease converge in the structure and\n', '   molecular biology of the bacterial cell wall.\n', "   Dr. Tomasz's laboratory uses biochemistry and molecular genetics in\n", '   combination with firsthand medical knowledge to study three basic\n', '   problems: how the bacterial cell wall is assembled and replicated; how\n', '   bacteria respond to antibiotic treatment and ultimately gain\n', "   resistance; and how bacteria cause human disease. Dr. Tomasz's work\n", '   focuses on Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, two\n', '   major human pathogens that frequently cause community- and\n', '   hospital-acquired disease. Multidrug-resistant clones of these two\n', '   pathogens have acquired global spread.\n', '\n', '   Cell walls may be envisioned as vast networks of covalent bonds\n', '   organized into macromolecular sheets with the shape and size of the\n', '   entire bacterial cell. How these "super" molecules are reproduced with\n', '   precision in every cell division as often as every 20 minutes is one of\n', '   the most intriguing questions of microbial cell biology. Using\n', '   conditional mutants of key cell wall biosynthetic genes, the Tomasz lab\n', '   aims to identify genetic determinants and protein catalysts involved\n', '   with this morphogenetic process.\n', '\n', '   Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem. Treatment of S. pneumoniae\n', '   and S. aureus with penicillins or glycopeptide antibiotics triggers a\n', '   suicidal process -- a kind of programmed cell death -- in the bacteria\n', '   that leads to the killing and dissolution of the cells. A special\n', '   mechanism named "antibiotic tolerance," which enables bacterial cells\n', '   to evade this intriguing suicidal pathway, was discovered in the Tomasz\n', '   lab in the mid-1970s.\n', '\n', '   Tolerant bacteria survive the antibiotic but are still inhibited by it.\n', '   Antibiotic-resistant bacteria can overcome even the inhibitory effects\n', '   of these agents. In the mid-1990s, the Tomasz lab was the first to\n', '   demonstrate that penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae involves the\n', '   reengineering of the structure of a family of proteins, named\n', '   penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), so as to reduce their affinity for\n', '   the antibiotic. The genetic program for this reengineering involves the\n', '   import of blocks of foreign DNA by pneumococci, which then use them to\n', '   alter genetic determinants of its PBPs and change their affinity for\n', '   the antibiotic. In the late 1960s, the Tomasz lab identified a critical\n', '   component of this DNA uptake mechanism: pneumococci secrete a\n', '   polypeptide that induces the expression of proteins to allow foreign\n', '   DNA to pass through its walls. This hormone-like substance was the\n', '   first of numerous "quorum-sensing" factors that have since been\n', '   identified in many microbial phenomena. Pneumococci with the\n', '   reengineered PBPs are not only resistant to penicillin but also show an\n', '   altered chemical structure of their cell walls.\n', '\n', '   All methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains carry a foreign gene called\n', '   mecA, which is the critical component of the resistance mechanism.\n', '   Recent data from the Tomasz lab strongly suggest that the evolutionary\n', '   source of mecA is a cell wall synthetic gene ubiquitous in all isolates\n', '   of the animal commensal species Staphylococcus sciuri.\n', '\n', '   Using whole genome sequencing, the Tomasz lab was recently able to\n', '   identify specific mutations that accompanied the evolution of\n', '   antibiotic resistance in an S. aureus strain recovered from the\n', '   bloodstream of a patient undergoing extensive chemotherapy by\n', '   vancomycin.\n', '\n', '   To understand how bacteria cause disease, the Tomasz lab is\n', '   investigating alterations in the chemical structure of the cell wall\n', '   that can have a profound impact on bacterial virulence. For instance,\n', '   mutants of S. pneumoniae that produce a cell wall lacking phosphoryl\n', '   choline residues suffer a profound loss in virulence.\n', '\n', '   The Tomasz lab is also using molecular fingerprinting to track the\n', '   spread of antibiotic-resistant clones of staphylococci and pneumococci.\n', '   Many of these investigations are done in collaboration with other labs\n', '   in Europe and South America.\n', '\n', 'CAREER\n', '\n', '   Dr. Tomasz, a native of Hungary, earned his Ph.D. in biochemistry from\n', "   Columbia University in 1963 and joined Rollin D.

The zygote has the potential\n', '   to form every cell type of the embryo and the adult organism through a\n', '   series of hierarchical cell fate decisions that involves cell-cell\n', '   interaction and signaling called embryonic induction. Dr. Brivanlou\n', '   wants to decipher the molecular circuitry that underlies the\n', '   establishment of discrete cell fate during early vertebrate\n', '   embryogenesis.\n', '\n', "   The Brivanlou lab's research focuses on the molecular events and\n", '   cellular interactions that regulate the emergence of key structures in\n', '   the early embryo. Most work in his laboratory focuses on the molecular\n', '   basis of cell fate specification and patterning during early embryonic\n', '   development. The ultimate objective is to understand the molecular\n', '   circuitry underlying embryonic induction, with special emphasis on the\n', '   formation of the nervous system. Toward this aim, he performs\n', '   comparative studies using amphibian and mammalian model systems,\n', '   including human embryonic stem cells (hESCs).\n', '\n', '   The Brivanlou laboratory has demonstrated that the TGF-b pathway plays\n', '   a central role in inductive interactions leading to the establishment\n', '   of different neural fates, which begins by the specification of the\n', '   brain. Subsequent work in vertebrates has irrevocably established the\n', '   pivotal role of these morphogens in the formation of specialized\n', '   tissues in the embryo. In studies of frog (Xenopus laevis) embryos, Dr.\n', '   Brivanlou has made several influential discoveries, including that all\n', '   embryonic cells will develop into nerve cells unless they receive\n', '   signals directing them otherwise. A concept, coined "the default model"\n', '   of neural induction, postulates that neural fate determination requires\n', '   the inhibition of an inhibitory signal. His laboratory has contributed\n', '   to the molecular and biochemical understanding of the TGF-b signaling\n', '   pathway and cross talk with other signaling networks, using frog and\n', '   mouse embryos and mammalian cell culture. The work led to the discovery\n', '   of the molecular basis of epidermal, neural crest and sensory placodes\n', '   and neural induction in comparative platforms.\n', '\n', '   Information obtained from this work provides a strong foundation for\n', '   research involving hESCs. To address whether the default model of\n', '   neural induction is conserved from amphibians to mammals (and humans in\n', "   particular), Dr. Brivanlou's laboratory was among the first to work\n", '   directly in hESCs. With private support from the Juvenile Diabetes\n', '   Research Foundation, Dr. Brivanlou and colleagues derived several hESC\n', '   lines, called RUES 1, 2 and 3. Using other private funds, his group\n', '   established an in vivo platform to study hESCs by demonstrating these\n', '   cells integrate into the mouse embryo, migrate to the inner cell mass\n', '   when put in close contact and divide and differentiate alongside their\n', '   mouse counterparts, suggesting the speed of differentiation of human\n', '   cells can be reprogrammed to match the mouse. The RUES lines were among\n', '   the first 13 hESC lines approved for use in research funded by the\n', '   National Institutes of Health (NIH), under the NIH Guidelines for Human\n', '   Stem Cell Research adopted in July 2009 under the Obama administration.\n', '   In this context, the group has recently developed new tools to perform\n', '   reversible transgenesis in human and rhesus monkey embryonic cell\n', '   lines, expressing a variety of reporter constructs controlled by germ\n', '   layer and tissue-specific regulatory elements.

Several collaborations with Rockefeller\n', '   University physics laboratories have also provided new insight, from\n', '   the use of quantum dots for embryonic imaging (with Albert J.\n', '   Libchaber) to development of new statistical tools for DNA microarray\n', '   and high throughput proteomic analysis (with Marcelo O.

These "nongenomic" forms of the classical sex hormone\n', '   receptors work in concert with the more classical genomic actions of\n', '   sex hormones on gene expression, and they increase excitatory synapse\n', '   formation and exert antiseizure and neuroprotective effects in\n', '   hippocampus and other brain regions.\n', '\n', '   In relation to stress, the McEwen lab has found that hormone actions on\n', '   structural plasticity are intertwined with the actions of excitatory\n', '   amino acid transmitters, kainate receptors, serotonin, GABA, other\n', '   neurotransmitters and BDNF. Dr. McEwen has found that, in the dentate\n', '   gyrus, chronic stress reduces neuron number and contributes to\n', '   cognitive impairment. In the hippocampus, chronic stress causes neurons\n', '   to undergo remodeling of dendrites.

To this end, his\n', '   laboratory investigates the circuitry of the brain and how the\n', '   interactions between groups of neurons contribute to perception,\n', '   learning and memory.\n', '\n', '   The Gilbert laboratory studies the primary visual cortex, a credit\n', '   card-sized region of cells at the back of the brain and the site of the\n', '   initial stage of cortical processing of information. The job of the\n', '   visual cortex is to take signals coming from the retina, group features\n', '   of visual scenes belonging to objects, and determine their shapes. The\n', '   laboratory investigates the mechanism, at the level of cortical\n', '   circuitry, by which this occurs. They discovered a plexus of long-range\n', '   horizontal connections that mediate the assembly of contours and the\n', '   parsing of visual scenes into objects and background. Using a\n', '   combination of single-cell electrophysiological recordings, optical\n', '   imaging of cortical functional architecture and multiphoton imaging of\n', '   labeled cortical connections, Dr. Gilbert has found close\n', '   correspondence between the geometry of these connections, the\n', '   functional properties of visual cortical neurons and the perception of\n', '   visual stimuli.\n', '\n', '   The laboratory also studies the way visual experience shapes the\n', '   strategy by which the cortex analyzes sensory information, a process\n', '   known as perceptual learning. They are interested in the contributions\n', '   of different cortical areas along the visual pathway that facilitate\n', '   this learning and are characterizing the functional changes at the\n', '   level of individual neurons. The Gilbert laboratory has found that,\n', '   even in adults, the visual cortex is capable of altering its functional\n', '   properties and circuitry as a response to experiencing visual stimuli.\n', '   These long-term changes aid in analyzing visual scenes as a result of\n', '   normal visual experience and play a role in functional recovery after\n', '   damage of the central nervous system. The role of experience in\n', '   altering cortical circuits is seen in the remapping of cortical\n', '   functional architecture following retinal lesions. This procedure\n', '   initially silences parts of the visual cortex, but over a period of\n', '   weeks the cortex regains its ability to respond to visual stimuli. They\n', '   found that the long-term changes involve axonal sprouting and\n', '   synaptogenesis. The lab is studying the molecular mechanisms underlying\n', '   experience-dependent changes in cortical circuits. Understanding\n', '   adaptive changes in cortical function at the level of functional\n', '   architecture, circuitry and gene expression provides important insights\n', '   into the mechanism of recovery after brain lesions and\n', '   neurodegenerative disease, including macular degeneration.\n', '\n', '   The Gilbert lab has shown that the properties of the visual cortex\n', '   reflect both sensory and behavioral contexts, suggesting that each\n', '   cortical area is an adaptive processor that runs different programs\n', '   according to the immediate demands of the perceptual task. Object\n', '   recognition, for example, involves a countercurrent process of\n', '   feedforward and feedback interactions. The top-down signal conveys\n', '   information about attentional locus, perceptual task and object\n', '   expectation. These results led to a novel view of cortical processing:\n', '   Rather than having fixed functional properties, adult neurons are\n', '   dynamically tuned, changing their specificities with varying sensory\n', '   experience and behavioral context. Understanding the role of top-down\n', '   interactions in sensory processing is likely to provide insight into\n', '   behavioral disorders such as schizophrenia and autism, which have been\n', '   suggested to be "disconnection syndromes," or a dysfunction of top-down\n', '   interactions between areas of the cerebral cortex. Based on these\n', "   findings, Dr. Gilbert's lab uses computational models to link cortical\n", '   circuits and the properties of neuronal ensembles to visual perception.\n', '\n', '   Dr. Gilbert and his colleagues use electrophysiology, imaging and\n', '   molecular approaches to understand the mechanisms of adult cortical\n', '   plasticity. Combining virally mediated gene transfer with two-photon\n', '   imaging, they have been able to study the contribution of different\n', '   neuronal types and circuit components to experience dependence changes\n', '   in cortical function. They study the circuitry and synaptic mechanisms\n', '   underlying the dynamic changes in functional properties of cortical\n', '   cells in behaving animals. They use electrophysiological recordings to\n', '   study the more complex properties of cortical cells and their\n', '   dependence on top-down influences and perceptual learning.

There is currently no\n', '   HCV vaccine, and although new antiviral drugs were recently approved\n', '   and are clinically available, more will be needed to combat resistance\n', "   and target all genotypes. Dr. Rice's lab focuses on understanding virus\n", '   replication, host responses to infection and developing new therapies\n', '   to treat HCV and other viral pathogens.\n', '\n', '   The Rice lab seeks new ways of blocking HCV infection by studying how\n', '   the virus replicates. Traditionally, blocking the actions of essential\n', '   viral enzymes has been key to generating effective antiviral drugs.\n', '   With collaborators at the University of Missouri, the lab has been\n', '   studying drug combinations and the mechanisms of drug resistance.  Dr.\n', "   Rice's group has also analyzed the biochemistry and structure of a\n", '   number of HCV proteins, such as the viral helicase, the nonstructural\n', '   protein NS5A, and the NS2-3 autoprotease. Since all are necessary for\n', '   virus replication, understanding how they work may help in the design\n', '   of new inhibitors that target these proteins.\n', '\n', "   Another of Dr. Rice's research interests is the development and\n", '   improvement of systems to propagate viruses in vitro and in vivo.  For\n', '   example, growing HCV in cell culture has been difficult and restricted\n', '   to only a few select genotypes and isolates.  Recently, the Rice group\n', '   found that overexpressing selected host cell proteins allows growth of\n', '   a broader number of HCV isolates, and studies of the mechanism by which\n', '   these proteins promote replication are underway.  A collaborative\n', '   effort with colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has\n', '   resulted in improved methods to infect otherwise healthy human\n', '   hepatocytes in culture. Unlike previous culture models, which depend on\n', '   cancerous cells, HCV infection of normal liver cells may more\n', '   accurately reflect what happens in a patient and yield clues about how\n', '   the virus causes disease.  More recently, this work has been extended\n', '   to studies of the viral life cycle in stem cell-derived hepatocytes,\n', '   which is paving the way toward personalized medicine applications.\n', "   Alongside improving culture systems, Dr. Rice's group has pioneered new\n", '   methods to concentrate HCV, enabling analysis of its structure and\n', '   composition with electron microscopy, which in turn, will inform the\n', '   design of vaccines and new drugs targeting virus particles.\n', '   Additionally, the Rice lab has been developing an HCV-permissive\n', '   transgenic mouse model, and also animals engrafted with human liver and\n', '   immune tissues susceptible to HCV infection and capable of mounting\n', '   human virus-specific immune responses.\n', '\n', '   The Rice lab is also interested in developing bioinformatic approaches\n', '   to study host-virus interactions at a systems level.  Using novel\n', '   techniques such as HITS-CLIP and RNAseq, the Rice lab is analyzing the\n', '   role of cellular micro RNAs and RNA-binding proteins in regulating the\n', '   replication of HCV and other RNA viruses.  Laser-capture\n', '   microdissection of infected, uninfected, and bystander cells has\n', '   allowed specific comparisons of the cellular responses at a genetic\n', '   level.  Because these experiments can be applied in a variety of\n', '   settings, such as different viruses, chronic vs. acute infection,\n', '   different genotypes or cell types, they will help to illuminate the\n', '   complex relationship between host and pathogen in a panoramic and\n', '   genome-wide view.\n', '\n', '   The strategies that viruses use to escape from host defenses are of\n', '   significant interest, as failure of the immune response can result in\n', '   chronic disease. Even as viruses evade adaptive immunity, innate\n', '   antiviral mechanisms may limit their replication and spread. Exploiting\n', '   innate cellular factors that limit viral entry and replication is an\n', '   additional strategy for developing antiviral therapeutics. The Rice lab\n', '   recently reported a comprehensive screen for antiviral activities of\n', '   naturally occurring cellular defense proteins, termed\n', '   interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Interestingly, unique combinations\n', '   of these genes, or "ISG profiles," were found to target different\n', '   viruses. Understanding the mechanisms of ISG inhibition is a\n', '   prerequisite to potential exploitation of these processes to interfere\n', '   with virus growth, and mechanistic studies are underway. The\n', '   zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) is an ISG that potently inhibits\n', '   the replication of members of the Alphavirus genus. Using the prototype\n', '   alphavirus, Sindbis virus, as a model system, investigators led by\n', '   Research Associate Professor Margaret R. MacDonald are working to\n', "   understand ZAP's mechanism and how it functions in concert with other\n", '   ISGs. Dr. MacDonald is also investigating the role of cellular\n', '   chaperone proteins in flavivirus RNA replication.\n', '\n', '   Together, all these investigations interrogate both sides of the\n', '   virus-host cell relationship, with the overarching objective of\n', '   designing efficacious new therapies and vaccines.  Additional studies\n', '   underway on viral pathogens related to HCV, such as dengue virus,\n', '   yellow fever virus, and influenza A virus will shed light on the\n', '   specificities of their interactions with host cells.  They will also be\n', '   broadly instructive toward novel strategies to tip the balance in the\n', '   age-old warfare between pathogenic viruses and their hosts.\n', '\n', 'CAREER\n', '\n', '   Dr. Rice received his Ph.D. in biochemistry in 1981 from the California\n', '   Institute of Technology, where he was then a postdoctoral research\n', '   fellow from 1981 to 1985.

Caenorhabditis elegans, a worm with just 302 neurons, shows\n', '   considerable sophistication in its behaviors, and its defined neuronal\n', '   wiring and genetic accessibility make it an ideal subject in which to\n', "   study these interactions. Dr. Bargmann's laboratory characterizes genes\n", '   and neural pathways that allow the nervous system to generate flexible\n', '   behaviors.\n', '\n', '   How do genes and the environment interact to generate a variety of\n', '   behaviors? How are behavioral decisions modified by context and\n', '   experience? The Bargmann lab is studying the relationships between\n', '   genes, experience, the nervous system and behavior in the nematode C.\n', '   elegans. C. elegans has a very simple nervous system that consists of\n', '   just 302 neurons with reproducible functions, morphologies and synaptic\n', '   connections. Despite this simplicity, many of the genes and signaling\n', '   mechanisms used in the nematode nervous system are similar to those of\n', '   mammals. The ability to manipulate the activity of individual genes and\n', '   neurons in C. elegans makes it possible to determine how neural\n', '   circuits develop and function.\n', '\n', "   C. elegans's most complex behaviors occur in response to smell, and\n", "   these are at the heart of the Bargmann lab's research. The tiny worm\n", '   can sense hundreds of different odors, discriminate among them and\n', '   generate reactions that are appropriate to the odor cue. Since its\n', "   nervous system is so simple, it's possible for researchers to determine\n", '   how individual neurons contribute to these behaviors. In C. elegans, as\n', '   in other animals, odors are detected by G protein coupled odorant\n', '   receptors on specialized sensory neurons. The odors that activate one\n', '   sensory neuron regulate a behavioral output such as attraction or\n', '   avoidance. The lab studies the pathways from sensory input to\n', '   behavioral output by quantitative analysis of behavior under\n', '   well-defined conditions, genetic manipulation of individual neuronal\n', '   cells, calcium imaging from neurons in living animals and forward and\n', '   reverse genetic approaches.\n', '\n', '   Dr. Bargmann is also investigating how much flexibility is present in a\n', '   simple nervous system. For example, C. elegans is capable\n', '   of learning the odors of different bacteria and avoiding those that\n', '   previously made it ill. These learned olfactory behaviors are\n', '   associated with neurochemical changes that lead to rapid behavioral\n', '   remodeling.\n', '\n', '   Another interest of the Bargmann laboratory is how genetic variation\n', '   between individuals can cause them to behave differently from one\n', '   another. In C. elegans, a single gene determines whether animals prefer\n', '   to eat alone or in social groups. This gene encodes a neuropeptide\n', '   receptor, a modulator that integrates multiple sensory inputs to\n', "   generate coordinated behaviors. A current focus of Dr. Bargmann's\n", '   research is on learning how modulatory systems, like this neuropeptide\n', '   receptor, affect the flow of information between neurons.\n', '\n', 'CAREER\n', '\n', '   Dr. Bargmann received her undergraduate degree in biochemistry from the\n', '   University of Georgia.

Members of Dr. Kronauer's laboratory use an\n", '   integrative approach to understand how natural selection shapes the\n', '   evolution of insect societies and how social life is regulated at\n', '   different hierarchical levels: the gene, the individual and the colony.\n', '\n', '   Insect societies are socially integrated to such an extent that they\n', '   are often portrayed as "superorganisms" in which different\n', '   morphological or behavioral castes have different functions, similar to\n', '   the different tissues of an organism. The networks of mutually attuned\n', '   specialists have enabled social insects to evolve to ecological\n', '   dominance in many terrestrial ecosystems. Most fundamentally, some\n', '   individuals, the workers, often completely forego egg laying and\n', '   dedicate their lives to colony maintenance, while others, the queens,\n', '   monopolize reproduction.\n', '\n', '   Dr. Kronauer uses ants as model systems to study different aspects of\n', '   social behavior and evolution. His current research focuses on army\n', '   ants, a large group of nomadic predatory ants that are of particular\n', '   ecological importance in tropical rainforests around the world. He\n', '   studies a variety of species in the field as well as under controlled\n', '   conditions in the laboratory.\n', '\n', "   One of the goals of Dr. Kronauer's research group is to understand the\n", '   evolution of social insect mating systems and how the genetic\n', '   composition of insect societies affects colony performance and shapes\n', '   the evolution of individual behavior. Dr. Kronauer has found that army\n', '   ant queens mate with more males than the queens of any other type of\n', '   ant, which results in genetically highly diverse colonies. High genetic\n', '   diversity might be adaptive in the largest and most complex insect\n', '   societies because it increases colony-level resistance against pathogen\n', '   infections, improves colony homeostasis and facilitates effective and\n', '   complex division of labor within the worker force. In at least one army\n', '   ant species, genetic diversity is achieved by colonies with multiple\n', '   reproductive queens, rather than by single queens that mate with many\n', '   males. Ongoing research in the lab also focuses on species that\n', '   reproduce asexually, which is rare among ants and can result in\n', '   colonies with genetically identical individuals. Several projects aim\n', '   at unraveling the genetic mechanisms and social consequences of such\n', '   idiosyncratic reproductive systems in ants.\n', '\n', '   Another line of investigation in the Kronauer lab addresses the\n', '   molecular basis of social behavior and division of labor. In social\n', '   insects, developmental trajectories, adult physiology and individual\n', '   behavior are highly dynamic and contingent upon the social environment.\n', '   A major challenge is to understand how the social environment is\n', '   perceived by an individual, how the social environment interacts with\n', "   an individual's genome to govern gene expression, how this affects\n", '   individual physiology and behavior and how the altered individual state\n', '   in turn feeds back into the social environment of the colony. To\n', '   address these questions, researchers in the Kronauer lab use molecular\n', '   genetic techniques, experimental manipulations and quantitative\n', '   behavioral assays under controlled laboratory conditions. In\n', '   particular, the Kronauer lab is developing and using the clonal raider\n', '   ant Cerapachys biroi as a new model system for social behavioral\n', '   genetics.\n', '\n', "   Finally, Dr. Kronauer's lab also studies the manifold interactions\n", '   between ants and other organisms. For example, the large societies of\n', '   army ants constitute a rich resource for a variety of arthropods. A\n', '   single army ant species, Eciton burchellii, is known to harbor over 300\n', '   species of arthropods, including mites, bristletails, wingless flies\n', '   and beetles. These species are entirely restricted to their host\n', '   colonies, and beyond scattered taxonomic descriptions, essentially\n', '   nothing is known about this microcosm. Dr. Kronauer and his\n', '   collaborators employ DNA barcoding and imaging techniques to inventory\n', '   army ant symbionts. They also use population genetics and chemical\n', '   analyses to study symbiont life history, adaptation and coevolution\n', '   with the ants.\n', '\n', 'CAREER\n', '\n', '   Dr. Kronauer received his diploma in biology from the University of\n', '   W\xfcrzburg in Germany in 2003, where he studied with Bert H\xf6lldobler.

The intestines absorb approximately 100 grams of\n', '   dietary proteins each day and are also home to an estimated 100\n', '   trillion commensal bacteria, about 10 times the number of cells of the\n', '   human body. To mediate immunity over such a large and active area,\n', '   there are more lymphocytes associated with the intestine than there are\n', '   in the entire rest of the human body.\n', '\n', '   Most intestinal lymphocytes display an activated phenotype, yet under\n', '   normal physiological conditions they remain in an immune quiescent\n', '   state. This so-called "gut physiological inflammation" is maintained by\n', '   distinct regulatory mechanisms, including regulatory lymphocytes and\n', '   dendritic cells. The Mucida laboratory works on understanding how the\n', '   immune system is regulated in intestinal mucosa and how it maintains a\n', '   balance between efficient immune response and tolerance to innocuous\n', '   antigens.\n', '\n', '   One of the goals of his laboratory is to characterize the cellular and\n', '   molecular mechanisms that lead to the development of pro-inflammatory\n', '   and regulatory cells at the mucosal surfaces, both from the innate and\n', '   the adaptive immune system. Dr. Mucida has shown that the intestine is\n', '   able to efficiently induce regulatory lymphocytes that can prevent\n', '   allergy and other inflammatory processes and that diet provides\n', '   precursors that can be used for the maintenance of intestinal\n', '   homeostasis. He has found that a vitamin A metabolite, retinoic acid,\n', '   produced by intestinal dendritic cells, is able to modulate the\n', '   development of inflammatory and regulatory cells.\n', '\n', "   A second interest of Dr. Mucida's lab is to understand how exposure to\n", '   different classes of commensal bacteria affects the development and\n', '   differentiation of immune cells and susceptibility to inflammatory\n', '   processes. The crucial role of the microbiota for the development and\n', '   maturation of the immune system is demonstrated by studies on germ-free\n', '   animals, which bear an immature immune system. However, not only the\n', '   number but also the type of bacteria can differentially influence\n', '   immune responses, with some classes of bacteria inhibiting while other\n', '   classes induce inflammatory cells. Dr. Mucida has found that commensal\n', '   bacteria are a crucial factor involved in the modulation of\n', '   inflammatory cells in the intestine. Although CD4 helper T cells are\n', '   crucial for the generation of efficient immune responses, uncontrolled\n', '   CD4 helper T cells can pose a threat to an organism, particularly in\n', '   chronically stimulated sites such as the mucosal surfaces. In\n', '   conventionally raised mice, but not in germ-free mice, the intestinal\n', '   environment efficiently suppresses CD4 helper T cell inflammatory\n', '   activity and redirects CD4 T cells to become CD8-like cytotoxic T\n', '   cells.\n', '\n', '   The Mucida laboratory also uses several animal models to study\n', '   intestinal and systemic infections to dissect the molecular and\n', '   cellular pathways triggered by infectious agents and how they can be\n', '   modulated to achieve protective, but not destructive, immune responses.\n', '   Although the great majority of antigenic sources in the mucosal\n', '   surfaces are nondeleterious, the intestine is also a major site of\n', '   entry for viruses, pathogenic bacteria, fungi and parasites. The\n', '   requirement for a rapid and efficient immune protection, however,\n', '   contrasts with the possibility of unregulated or excessive immune\n', '   responses toward gut antigens, which can lead to allergies and severe\n', '   inflammatory bowel diseases.\n', '\n', 'CAREER\n', '\n', '   Dr. Mucida received his undergraduate degree in biology, with an\n', '   emphasis on biochemistry and immunology, from the Federal University of\n', '   Minas Gerais in Brazil in 2000.

David Allis\n', '\n', '   Although every gene exists within every cell in the human body, only a\n', '   small percentage of genes is activated in any given cell. To manage\n', '   this genetic information efficiently, nature has evolved a\n', '   sophisticated system that facilitates access to specific genes. Dr.\n', '   Allis studies the DNA-histone protein complex called chromatin, which\n', '   packages the genetic information that exists within each cell and\n', '   serves as a means of gene regulation that lies outside of the DNA\n', '   itself -- the basis of epigenetics.\n', '\n', '   Chromatin is the physiological template of the human genome. Elaborate\n', '   mechanisms have evolved to introduce meaningful variation into\n', '   chromatin to alter gene expression and other important biological\n', '   processes. Three major mechanisms of this are covalent histone\n', '   modifications, chromatin remodeling by ATP-dependent complexes and use\n', '   of histone variants. Dr. Allis and his colleagues hypothesize that\n', '   distinct patterns of covalent histone modifications form a histone or\n', '   epigenetic "code" that is read by effector proteins to bring about\n', '   distinct downstream events. Histone proteins, their posttranslational\n', '   modifications and the enzyme systems responsible for generating them\n', '   are highly conserved through evolution. The Allis lab is currently\n', '   investigating different histone modifications and their biological\n', '   roles in a variety of unicellular and multicellular eukaryotic models.\n', '   Through such enzymatic processes as acetylation, methylation,\n', '   phosphorylation and ubiquitylation, histones are believed to function\n', '   like master on/off switches and determine whether particular genes are\n', '   active or inactive. Knowing how to turn particular genes on or off\n', '   could reduce the risk of certain diseases.\n', '\n', '   The frequent, high-density posttranslational modifications (PTMs) in\n', '   histone proteins have led members of the Allis laboratory to\n', '   hypothesize that PTMs are located in strategic locations along the\n', '   histone tail as a way for the cell to deal, reversibly, with gene\n', '   silencing or, in contrast, gene activation. The lab has been a\n', '   front-runner in deciphering elaborate cross talk relationships in the\n', '   same histone tails (cis) or across distinct histone tails (trans). It\n', '   appears that these regulatory pathways govern chromatin function during\n', '   DNA replication and repair, chromosome segregation and chromatin\n', '   compaction as cells undergo apoptosis. The combinatorial readout of\n', '   distinct histone modifications that lead to the specification of unique\n', '   downstream biological processes has been termed the "histone or\n', '   epigenetic code" -- a widely cited and influential hypothesis.\n', '\n', '   More recently, researchers in the Allis lab proposed that the mammalian\n', '   genome is indexed by H3 variants in a nonrandom fashion reflecting the\n', '   assembly mechanisms of dedicated, personalized chaperone proteins and\n', '   exchange factors that control whether genes are constitutively\n', '   expressed or remain silent. The Allis lab produced the first\n', '   genome-wide maps of H3.3 localization, first in mammalian embryonic\n', '   stem cells and then again after the cells had differentiated to become\n', '   neurons. Biochemical approaches have led them to chaperone complexes\n', '   that engage H3.3 selectively, depositing it into distinct regions of\n', '   the genome. One of these chaperone systems (ATRX/Daxx targeting H3.3 to\n', '   telomeres and other heterochromatic loci) has been shown to be mutated\n', '   in a significant fraction of patients who suffer from pancreatic\n', '   neuroendocrine tumors. Remarkably, H3.3 mutations are also highly\n', '   specific to pediatric gliomas, a disease that is clinically and\n', '   molecularly distinct from its adult counterpart. Dr. Allis and his\n', '   colleagues hypothesize that these mutations can alter the recruitment\n', '   and activity of histone-modifying complexes and therefore alter the\n', '   epigenetic landscape and dysregulate gene expression. Given the\n', '   restricted distribution of H3.3 mutations to pediatric gliomas, they\n', '   further hypothesize that cell lineage-specific cellular context is\n', '   crucial for the ability of these mutations to mediate oncogenesis.\n', '   Active investigations are under way to test these hypotheses with\n', '   collaborators in more clinically relevant settings, including human\n', '   patients.\n', '\n', 'CAREER\n', '\n', '   Dr. Allis received his Ph.D. in 1978 from Indiana University and\n', '   performed postdoctoral work with Martin Gorovsky at the University of\n', '   Rochester.

This ion flow underlies such vital\n', '   functions as electrical signaling in nerve, heart and muscle cells,\n', '   cell volume regulation, secretion of hormones and neurotransmitters,\n', "   fertilization and kidney function. Dr. Gadsby's research focuses on how\n", '   ion transport proteins work.\n', '\n', '   Two principal classes of proteins regulate ion movement across\n', '   membranes: pumps and channels. Although both move ions through the\n', "   cell's otherwise impenetrable phospholipid bilayer, they play distinct\n", '   roles. Channels allow ions to flow rapidly down their electrochemical\n', '   gradients, while pumps move ions relatively slowly, thermodynamically\n', '   uphill, thereby building up those gradients. Pumps and channels have\n', '   therefore traditionally been viewed as very different entities. Dr.\n', "   Gadsby's work, however, suggests these membrane proteins are far more\n", '   closely related than generally assumed.\n', '\n', '   The Gadsby lab is using position-specific mutagenesis, combined with\n', '   structural modeling and biochemical and electrical measurements, to\n', '   examine the mechanisms of two biomedically important ion transport\n', '   proteins. One, the Na^+/K^+-adenosine triphosphatase, is a pump, and\n', '   the other, the cystic fibrosis-linked protein known as CFTR (cystic\n', '   fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), is a Cl^- ion channel.\n', '   The Na^+/K^+ pump establishes the transmembrane gradients of Na^+ and\n', '   K^+ ions crucial to animal cell life, whereas CFTR channels conduct\n', '   Cl^- ions across membranes of epithelial cells, allowing simultaneous\n', '   movement of water. Mutations in the CFTR gene are responsible for\n', '   cystic fibrosis. Mutations in the Na^+/K^+ pumps of brain neurons have\n', '   recently been found responsible for neurological disorders in children.\n', '\n', '   Research from the Gadsby lab suggests that, just as an ion channel can\n', '   be viewed as an ion pathway controlled by a gate at one end, an ion\n', '   pump can be viewed as a modified ion channel controlled by gates at\n', '   both ends. The gates in a pump must be tightly coupled so they are\n', '   never both open simultaneously. From this perspective, the\n', '   conformational changes that open and close the ion pathway gates in the\n', '   two kinds of transport need not be all that different. Indeed, in both\n', '   the Na^+/K^+ pump and CFTR Cl^- channel, these conformational changes\n', '   are driven by binding and hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).\n', '\n', '   In work on CFTR, lab members use the sensitive patch-clamp recording\n', '   technique to analyze the timing of the opening and closing of\n', '   individual wild-type and mutant CFTR channels as they are exposed to\n', '   ATP and/or nucleotide analogues. So far, they have found that ATP binds\n', '   to both nucleotide-binding domains in a single CFTR molecule before the\n', '   gate in its channel opens, that the two binding sites interact to\n', "   regulate each other's function and that one of them acts like a G\n", '   protein. The nucleotide bound there stabilizes the active, open-channel\n', '   conformation until its hydrolysis prompts channel closure. From such\n', '   findings, the Gadsby lab has detailed the accepted model for how the\n', '   opening and closing of the CFTR ion channel is regulated, furthering\n', '   understanding of the origins of cystic fibrosis.\n', '\n', '   In work on the Na^+/K^+ pump, a marine toxin has been used that\n', "   interferes with the strict coupling between the pump's two gates. When\n", '   the toxin is bound to the pump, the two gates are occasionally both\n', '   open, and the pump is transformed into an ion channel. Dr. Gadsby is\n', '   exploiting this action to probe the pathway through the Na^+/K^+ pump\n', '   as well as the nature and control of its gates. In work on unmodified\n', '   native Na^+/K^+ pumps, Dr. Gadsby and colleagues have shown the pumps\n', '   release three Na^+ ions to the cell exterior in three distinct,\n', '   obligatorily sequential, gating steps, with progressively faster\n', '   speeds. Most recently, the Gadsby lab has found that during the normal\n', '   Na^+/K^+ transport cycle, a certain conformation of the Na^+/K^+ pump\n', '   can be hijacked by extracellular protons to access the cell interior.\n', '   The probability of proton entry through any given Na^+/K^+ pump depends\n', '   on the extracellular proton concentration. The Na^+/K^+ pump is thus a\n', '   hybrid transporter, a protein with two distinct functions.\n', '\n', 'CAREER\n', '\n', "   Dr. Gadsby received his bachelor's degree in 1969 and his master's in\n", '   1973, both in physiology and biophysics from the University of\n', '   Cambridge, where he attended Trinity College.

His laboratory's research has focused on steroid hormone\n", '   effects on nerve cells as they direct natural, instinctive behaviors,\n', '   as well as the influences of hormones and genes on generalized brain\n', '   arousal.\n', '\n', "   Dr. Pfaff's research has proceeded through four steps to demonstrate\n", '   how steroid hormone effects on nerve cells can direct natural,\n', '   instinctive behaviors. First, Dr. Pfaff is known for discovering exact\n', '   cellular targets for steroid hormones in the brain. A system of\n', '   hypothalamic and limbic forebrain neurons with sex hormone receptors,\n', '   discovered in rodents, was later found to be present in species ranging\n', '   from fish to primates. Dr. Pfaff recently found that knocking out the\n', '   gene for the estrogen receptor in animals prevents female reproductive\n', "   behavior and maternal behaviors. Second, Dr. Pfaff's lab has worked out\n", '   the neural circuitry for hormone-dependent female reproductive\n', '   behavior, the first behavior circuit elucidated for any mammal. Third,\n', '   they have demonstrated that estrogens can turn on several genes in the\n', '   forebrain. And fourth, Dr. Pfaff has shown that these gene products\n', '   facilitate reproductive behavior. Together, these four advances proved\n', '   how specific chemicals acting in specific parts of the brain determine\n', '   individual behavioral responses.\n', '\n', '   In experiments uniting the immune, endocrine and nervous systems with\n', '   behavior, Dr. Pfaff and his colleagues were the first to genetically\n', '   link the neuroimmune system to emotional behavior, showing that mast\n', '   cells in the brain mediate anxious behavior in mice. They also found\n', '   that the nervous system protein GnRH promotes reproductive behavior as\n', '   well as directs the pituitary to stimulate the ovaries and testes. Dr.\n', "   Pfaff's lab discovered that GnRH-producing neurons emerge from the\n", '   olfactory epithelium and migrate up the nose and into the forebrain and\n', '   that genetic interruption of that migration, especially in men, results\n', '   in inadequate testosterone and loss of libido.\n', '\n', "   Dr. Pfaff's study of generalized arousal, which activates all\n", '   behavioral responses, led to the first operational definition of the\n', '   term, enabling scientists to measure arousal quantitatively in\n', '   laboratory animals and humans. In humans, deficits in arousal\n', '   contribute to cognitive problems such as attention\n', "   deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism and Alzheimer's disease, and\n", '   analyzing the mechanisms of arousal may lead to pharmacological methods\n', '   to enhance alertness and sleep, and to more precise anesthesiology.\n', '   Recently, Dr. Pfaff and his colleagues pitted two forces of arousal --\n', '   hunger and circadian rhythms -- against each other, showing that these\n', '   two pathways converge at the ventromedial hypothalamus and that this\n', '   brain region is the first to register changes in food availability.\n', '\n', '   In conjunction with Alex Proekt, a visiting fellow in the lab, Dr.\n', '   Pfaff and his team are using mathematical statistics to search for the\n', '   quantitative properties of a brain emerging from a nonaroused state to\n', '   an aroused state. Dr. Proekt demonstrated that the transition from\n', '   inactivity to the activation of behavior follows a power law and then\n', '   showed that emergence from anesthetic-caused unconsciousness is not a\n', '   smooth, monotonic process but instead requires the brain to dwell\n', '   temporarily in dynamic "hub states." The team is interested in\n', '   understanding the temporal patterns of neural activity in arousal\n', "   systems that explain a person's emergence from anesthesia.\n", '\n', '   Finally, studies in the lab have indicated that the origins of central\n', '   nervous system arousal reside in the activities of large neurons, deep\n', '   in the hindbrain, called nucleus gigantocellularis. A postdoc in the\n', '   lab, Inna Tabansky, is using stem cell technology to produce these\n', '   neurons from mouse embryonic stem cells. In parallel, her team is\n', '   studying the normal lineage of nucleus gigantocellularis in the\n', '   developing mouse brain. Taken together, her studies will address\n', '   questions on the origins of arousal and have implications for certain\n', '   neurodevelopmental disorders.\n', '\n', 'CAREER\n', '\n', '   Dr. Pfaff graduated from Harvard College magna cum laude and received\n', '   his Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1965.

They are learning how embryonic and\n', '   adult stem cells establish unique programs of gene expression that\n', '   determine when they divide and what types of cells they develop into.\n', '   Recent work in the Fuchs lab has shown that a structure at the base of\n', '   each strand of hair, the hair follicle, uses mesenchymal-epithelial\n', '   interactions to acquire a threshold of activating signals that instruct\n', '   stem cells to divide during periods of hair growth.

The\n", '   Nottebohm laboratory has developed transgenic zebra finches that\n', '   express the human mutant gene that causes the disorder and uses song\n', '   learning and song production to track the modus operandi of the mutant\n', '   gene. Dr. Nottebohm is also interested in how our view of ourselves and\n', '   of the universe came to be.\n', '\n', '   The Nottebohm laboratory has worked on the neurobiology of vocal\n', '   learning in songbirds, work that uncovered the circuits for the\n', '   acquisition and production of learned vocalizations and revealed that\n', '   some of the song nuclei were sexually dimorphic and changed volume\n', '   seasonally. A closer inspection of this phenomenon in a particular song\n', '   nucleus led to the discovery that new neurons were continually produced\n', '   in adulthood and that survival of the new neurons was affected by use\n', '   and disuse. These neurons were born by division of radial glia in the\n', '   ventricular zone of the lateral ventricle and from there migrated\n', '   through the adult telencephalon to their final destination. In\n', '   canaries, which learn new songs every year, the production of new\n', '   neurons was accompanied by the replacement of older neurons of the same\n', '   kind that had died. This replacement peaked at times of song change. In\n', '   zebra finches, which learn their song only once, the new neurons born\n', '   in adulthood did not replace others, but led to a net gain in their\n', '   numbers; as this happened, song became more stereotyped and resistant\n', '   to deafening. These findings challenged existing ideas that held that\n', '   all the plasticity required for learning was vested in the number and\n', '   status of synapses. In parts of the songbird forebrain not related to\n', '   song, neurons are replaced in adulthood at times of peak novel\n', '   stimulation.\n', '\n', '   Ongoing work in the Nottebohm laboratory, led by senior research\n', '   associate Wan-Chun Liu, is focused on understanding neurodegenerative\n', "   disorders.

The mutant human gene has 145 CAG repeats and\n", '   is passed down from one generation to the next. These transgenic birds\n', '   show difficulty copying the song of an adult model, and once they reach\n', '   adulthood the song starts to deteriorate. The researchers are\n', '   interested in understanding whether the difficulties with song learning\n', '   and the time of onset and extent of song deterioration are related to\n', '   the number of CAG repeats and, if so, in what manner. Only four CAG\n', '   repeats normally occur in zebra finches.\n', '\n', '   Dr. Nottebohm has also turned his attention to a project in which he\n', '   has had a long-standing interest: the history of key events in human\n', '   evolution and in the evolution of human culture.

The lab has a particular interest in understanding how\n', '   central brain structures, distant from the sensory and motor periphery,\n', '   govern behavioral choice.\n', '\n', '   Whereas much is known about sensory and motor processing in\n', '   the nervous system, it remains less clear how brains perform higher,\n', '   integrative functions such as deciding to initiate a movement, changing\n', '   course once a movement has begun, incorporating past experiences into\n', '   ongoing behavioral choices, flexibly coupling sensory inputs to correct\n', '   motor outputs and ignoring irrelevant sensory stimuli so as to focus on\n', '   relevant stimuli. The Maimon\n', '   lab studies integrative processes such as these in the fruit fly,\n', '   Drosophila melanogaster.\n', '\n', '   Fruit flies are an established system for genetics, with over 100 years\n', '   of seminal findings. Flies have also served an important role in\n', '   ethology, the study of natural animal behavior, and comparative studies\n', '   across Drosophila have shed light on how innate behaviors evolve. The\n', '   Maimon lab combines these classical approaches with modern\n', '   electrophysiological methods to gain new insights into higher brain\n', '   function.\n', '\n', '   Because flies are small, it has not been possible, traditionally, to\n', '   record neuronal activity as they behave. Dr. Maimon recently developed\n', '   a platform for behavioral neurophysiology in Drosophila. The primary\n', '   approach taken by the lab is to use this new methodology to record the\n', '   electrical activity of genetically identified neurons in actively\n', '   behaving flies. In these experiments, flies typically perform tethered\n', '   flight or walking behaviors in response to sensory stimuli, such as\n', '   visual images presented on a panoramic display. The Maimon lab uses the\n', '   sensitive patch-clamp technique to measure small changes in membrane\n', '   voltage or current in single neurons. They combine this technique with\n', '   imaging approaches to visualize physiological activity in larger groups\n', '   of cells. The behavioral-physiological experiments typically lead to\n', '   studies at the molecular-genetic level, to flesh out mechanism, and\n', '   quantitative investigations of free behavior, to inform function.\n', '\n', '   As a first use of the behavioral-physiology platform, Dr. Maimon\n', '   obtained recordings from a well-studied class of visual neurons in the\n', '   fly brain, the vertical system (VS) cells. These neurons process visual\n', '   motion and are thought to help flies stabilize their flight; however,\n', '   no one had recorded from VS cells while flies were actually flying. Dr.\n', '   Maimon demonstrated that VS cells double their response strength during\n', '   flight, suggesting that the brain can dynamically increase the gain of\n', '   visual signals when necessary. This change in gain may act like a gate;\n', '   VS cells may drive downstream neurons effectively during locomotion,\n', '   when response gain is high, but ineffectively during behavioral\n', '   quiescence, when response gain is low. Similar gain changes have been\n', '   observed in other species, including vertebrates, and thus studying\n', '   Drosophila may give insight into how and why brains dynamically change\n', '   the strength of sensory signals.\n', '\n', '   Current work is focused on central, integrative structures deeper\n', '   within the fly nervous system and on developing behavioral paradigms to\n', '   probe how flies compute and store the value of behaviorally relevant\n', '   variables.

They are\n', '   also highly versatile, because transport substrates include both\n', '   proteins and nucleoproteins. Moreover, transport through the nuclear\n', '   pore complex is selective and bidirectional. And with approximately\n', '   1,000 copies per nucleated cell, nuclear pore complexes are among the\n', '   most abundant channels in multicellular organisms -- humans with\n', '   approximately 10^ 12 cells have around 10^15 nuclear pore complexes.\n', '   Not surprisingly, malfunctioning of nuclear pore complexes and\n', '   nucleo-cytoplasmic transport gives rise to numerous diseases. The term\n', '   "nuclear pore complex" was introduced in 1958 by Michael Watson,\n', '   working in the Rockefeller University laboratory of Keith Porter and\n', '   George Palade.\n', '\n', '   Because of the eight-fold symmetry of the nuclear pore complex, each of\n', '   the nucleoporins occurs in multiples of eight copies.

Toward this goal, nucleoporins (or segments thereof, termed\n', '   "protomers") are expressed in bacterial cells, purified, crystallized\n', '   and analyzed by x-ray crystallography.

All animal cells have a genetic program that, when activated,\n', "   leads to a distinct form of cell death called apoptosis. Dr. Steller's\n", '   research focuses on how this death program is regulated by different\n', '   signaling pathways and how abnormal regulation of apoptosis contributes\n', '   to a variety of human diseases, including cancer.\n', '\n', '   Because apoptosis is central to both development and tissue homeostasis\n', '   and is intimately associated with a variety of human diseases including\n', '   cancer, autoimmunity, AIDS, neurodegenerative disorders and liver\n', '   diseases, cell death proteins are promising drug targets. Using both\n', "   Drosophila melanogaster and mice as model organisms, Dr. Steller's\n", '   laboratory investigates the molecular mechanisms that govern the\n', '   decision between cell death and survival.\n', '\n', '   Apoptosis has been conserved in evolution from worms to insects to\n', "   humans. Dr. Steller's lab discovered and characterized a family of\n", '   proteins that act as integrators of many different signaling pathways\n', '   to ensure that the death program is activated in cells that are doomed\n', '   to die. Reaper, Hid and Grim activate apoptosis by binding to and\n', '   inactivating inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins, which in turn\n', '   directly inhibit caspases, the key executioners of apoptosis. In this\n', '   way, Reaper-family proteins remove powerful "brakes" on death. A\n', '   conserved IAP-binding motif that was originally discovered in these\n', '   proteins has provided the basis for developing a novel class of cancer\n', '   therapeutics that are currently being evaluated in clinical trials.\n', '\n', '   Many organs and tissues can repair wounds and regenerate cells that\n', '   have been lost upon injury. Dr. Steller discovered that cells\n', '   undergoing apoptosis in response to stress or injury (such as\n', '   radiation) can stimulate their own replacement by secreting mitogens to\n', '   induce proliferation of adjacent progenitor cells. These secreted\n', '   mitogens include Wingless (Wnt) and BMP/TGF-b-family proteins. These\n', '   pathways have been highly conserved in evolution, and similar phenomena\n', '   have been recently observed in mammals. These findings have profound\n', '   implications for cancer therapy, stem cell biology and regenerative\n', '   medicine.\n', '\n', '   The cell death machinery can also serve nonlethal functions for\n', "   cellular remodeling in Drosophila and mammals. Dr. Steller's work\n", '   initially revealed the importance of this process for the generation of\n', '   mature sperm, but subsequently similar mechanisms were shown to operate\n', '   during development of the nervous system. Dr. Steller defined the role\n', '   of enzymes that control protein degradation in this system, and he\n', '   recently discovered a new mechanism for regulating the activity of\n', '   proteasomes, the proteolytic complex responsible for the degradation of\n', '   most intracellular proteins. Collectively, this work reveals that the\n', '   two major proteolytic systems, caspases and proteasomes, are\n', '   coordinated to achieve "controlled demolition" of unwanted cellular\n', '   structures. These findings are relevant for a better understanding and\n', '   treatment of human diseases, including muscle-wasting diseases and\n', '   cancer.\n', '\n', '   The Steller lab also studies cells that are highly resistant to cell\n', '   death, including terminally differentiated neurons. Using Drosophila\n', '   photoreceptor neurons as a model system, Dr. Steller is researching the\n', '   survival mechanisms by which these cells resist apoptosis; one involves\n', '   the unfolded protein response, which has been linked to diabetes,\n', "   cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. However, Dr. Steller's lab has\n", '   shown that in a Drosophila model of autosomal dominant retinitis\n', '   pigmentosa, a disease that causes blindness, the unfolded protein\n', '   response is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum organelle, not the\n', '   cytoplasm, and protects cells from apoptosis. This research has added\n', '   another level of complexity to the role of unfolded proteins in cell\n', '   death and disease.\n', '\n', '   While Dr. Steller uses Drosophila as the primary model to discover cell\n', '   death genes and order them into pathways, his lab is also testing\n', '   whether concepts originally developed in Drosophila can be applied to\n', '   mammalian systems and translated to the clinic. For this purpose, Dr.\n', '   Steller and his colleagues have generated mouse strains with mutations\n', '   in select cell death genes. This work has provided the first direct\n', '   evidence for a role of mammalian IAP antagonists in caspase regulation\n', "   and tumor suppression in vivo. Finally, Dr. Steller's laboratory is\n", '   developing small-molecule compounds that are designed to selectively\n', '   activate apoptosis in cancer cells for highly specific and efficient\n', '   tumor cell killing.\n', '\n', 'CAREER\n', '\n', '   Born in Germany, Dr. Steller received his undergraduate degree in\n', '   microbiology and molecular genetics from the University of Frankfurt in\n', '   1981.

These events must occur at the right\n', '   place, at the right time, in the right order. In particular, the\n', '   Funabiki lab studies the following subjects.\n', '\n', '   Spatial control of chromosome-induced signals during mitosis. The\n', '   Funabiki lab has demonstrated that mitosis-specific phosphorylation of\n', '   histone H3, the major component of chromosomes, plays a key role in\n', '   formation of the spindle, a cellular apparatus to segregate\n', '   chromosomes. They have shown that Survivin, whose expression is\n', '   implicated in cancer development, binds histone H3 that is\n', '   phosphorylated at the threonine 3 residue (H3T3ph). This binding\n', '   results in recruitment and activation of the kinase Aurora B, which\n', '   leads to spindle assembly around chromosomes. At the end of mitosis,\n', '   chromosomes must stop supporting the spindle assembly and initiate\n', '   nuclear envelope assembly. However, the nuclear envelope should not\n', '   reform before completion of chromosome segregation, and thus the timing\n', '   of this conversion must be accurately controlled. The Funabiki lab has\n', '   shown that dephosphorylation of H3T3ph plays a key role in this\n', '   process, and they revealed the molecular mechanism behind the\n', '   spatiotemporal control of this phosphorylation. Furthermore, they have\n', '   identified a novel chromatin-associated regulator of microtubule\n', '   dynamics, Dppa2, which plays a critical role in controlling the proper\n', '   size and shape of the nucleus. Through these studies, Dr. Funabiki aims\n', '   to understand the mechanisms by which the precise order of events\n', '   during mitosis is controlled by chromatin-induced signals.\n', '\n', '   Mechanical control that transduces microtubule attachment into the\n', '   chemical signal to permit chromosome separation. In order to segregate\n', '   chromosomes, microtubules must attach to the proteinaceous structure,\n', '   the kinetochore, which is built on each centromere of chromosomes.\n', '   Importantly, until all the kinetochores attach to microtubules in the\n', '   right orientation, unattached kinetochores activate a signaling pathway\n', '   called the "spindle assembly checkpoint" to delay sister chromatid\n', '   separation and exit from mitosis. Dr. Funabiki aims to understand the\n', '   mechanism by which the microtubule attachment event can be converted\n', '   into checkpoint silencing. In addition, using superresolution\n', '   microscopy, they are studying how the three-dimensional architecture of\n', '   the kinetochore is modulated by microtubule attachment status.\n', '\n', '   Roles of histone modifications during the cell cycle.

Hudspeth\n', '\n', '   The majority of the hearing impaired suffer from sensorineural hearing\n', '   loss, also referred to as "nerve deafness." Despite its name, this type\n', '   of hearing loss usually results from damage to the hair cells of the\n', '   inner ear. The human cochlea contains about 16,000 of these hair cells,\n', "   which do not regenerate once they have been damaged. Dr. Hudspeth's\n", '   laboratory is working to better understand the normal hearing process\n', '   and causes of hearing deterioration as an initial step toward the\n', '   prevention or reversal of deafness.\n', '\n', '   Sound consists of rapid pressure fluctuations in the air, and hearing\n', '   commences when these signals impinge upon the external ear, setting the\n', '   eardrum into oscillatory motion. This movement is relayed through the\n', '   three miniscule bones of the middle ear -- the hammer, anvil and\n', '   stirrup -- to the snail-shaped cochlea. Within the cochlea, these\n', '   mechanical signals are converted into vibrations along the basilar\n', '   membrane, upon which the hair cells stand in four ranks. Each hair cell\n', '   is endowed with a few hundred fine "feelers," or stereocilia, that\n', '   collectively constitute its hair bundle. Sound-induced vibrations set\n', '   the hair bundles in motion, evoking electrical responses by opening and\n', '   closing mechanically sensitive ion channels in the stimulated bundles.\n', '   As a result of the direct mechanical connection between the hair bundle\n', '   and ion channels, the transduction process of hair cells is remarkably\n', '   rapid; we can consequently hear sounds at frequencies as great as 20\n', '   kHz. The direct nature of auditory transduction also makes the process\n', '   highly sensitive.\n', '\n', '   The extraordinary sensitivity of our hearing suggests that the cochlea\n', "   amplifies its mechanical inputs, and researchers in Dr. Hudspeth's lab\n", '   are exploring how human hearing benefits from a tiny mechanical\n', '   amplifier in each hair bundle. They have found that bundles are\n', '   spontaneously active, oscillating through a distance of \xb130 nm. This\n', '   unprovoked activity likely underlies the spontaneous emission of sound\n', '   measured from many normal ears, including those of 70 percent of\n', '   humans. When a small stimulus force is applied to an active bundle, the\n', "   bundle's motion becomes synchronized with the stimulus. Measurement of\n", '   the mechanical work performed in this situation confirms that a hair\n', '   bundle can amplify and tune its mechanical inputs. Members of the\n', '   research group are now extending these results to the mammalian ear.\n', '   Using a theoretical approach to model the mammalian ear, they are also\n', '   exploring the mechanism by which low-frequency sounds are amplified.\n', '   Identifying the active process in the human cochlea is especially\n', '   important because hearing loss usually begins with deterioration of\n', '   this amplifier.\n', '\n', "   In an effort to learn how hair cells develop, Dr. Hudspeth's group is\n", '   conducting molecular-biological experiments on the larval zebra-fish.\n', '   In the lateral line of this species, new hair cells arise continually\n', '   to replace those that die as a result of aging or chemical toxicity.\n', '   The division of a precursor cell consistently produces a pair of hair\n', '   cells of opposite polarity, one of which responds to water movement\n', "   toward the animal's anterior, the other sensitive to posterior flow. In\n", '   the hope of establishing what signaling pathways lead to the production\n', '   of new hair cells, members of the group are isolating both hair cells\n', '   and their precursors and examining their gene expression. The\n', '   investigators hope to identify pathways that might be activated in the\n', '   human ear to foster hair cell replacement. Other experimenters are\n', '   studying how individual nerve fibers distinguish between hair cells of\n', '   the two polarities, selectively innervating only one of the two sets.\n', '\n', "   Dr. Hudspeth's research has led to a deepened understanding of the\n", '   intricacies of the inner ear and how they contribute to hearing and\n', '   hearing loss.

The\n', '   laboratory revealed that single-gene inborn errors of immunity in\n', '   children may confer severe and selective vulnerability to certain\n', '   infectious illnesses, whereas corresponding infections in adults result\n', '   more from complex inheritance. This work not only blurs the distinction\n', '   between patient-based Mendelian genetics and population-based complex\n', '   genetics but also provides experimental support for a unified genetic\n', '   theory of human infectious diseases.\n', '\n', '   Since the 1950s and until recently, it was believed that mutations in a\n', '   single gene confer vulnerability to multiple infectious diseases,\n', '   whereas common infections have been associated with the inheritance of\n', '   multiple susceptibility genes. Dr. Casanova and Laurent Abel identified\n', '   and characterized new genetic defects that predispose otherwise healthy\n', '   individuals to a single type of infection, a novel causal relationship\n', '   that modified the paradigm that had dominated the field for decades.\n', '\n', "   Dr. Casanova's team has identified inborn errors of immunity conferring\n", '   increased susceptibility to specific pathogens.

In parallel, Dr. Abel's team showed\n", '   that several common infections, such as schistosomiasis and leprosy,\n', '   reflect the inheritance of major susceptibility genes, as defined by\n', '   segregation and/or linkage studies, at least in some populations.\n', '\n', '   In this context, Dr. Casanova and his colleague Dr. Abel discovered the\n', '   first cases of Mendelian predisposition to tuberculosis in children and\n', '   the first major susceptibility locus for this disease in adults. This\n', '   work strongly supports the notion of a continuous spectrum of genetic\n', '   susceptibility to infectious diseases, ranging from Mendelian\n', '   predisposition in children (during primary infection) to complex\n', '   predisposition in adults (during reinfection or reactivation from\n', '   latency). The laboratory is now focused on testing the hypothesis that\n', '   life-threatening infectious diseases of childhood result from\n', '   collections of rare single-gene inborn errors of immunity.\n', '\n', '   Altogether, the discoveries revealed that many immunological circuits\n', '   that were thought to play a broad role in host defense are largely\n', '   redundant and essential for immunity against only one or a few specific\n', '   infections. Dr. Casanova and Dr. Abel hope to decipher the genetic\n', '   basis of several infectious diseases, thereby defining the function of\n', '   host defense genes in the natural ecosystem in which human populations\n', '   live and are subjected to natural selection.\n', '\n', '   Revealing monogenic holes in the immune defense of otherwise healthy\n', '   children also has profound clinical implications, offering many\n', '   families worldwide the possibility of molecular diagnosis and genetic\n', '   counseling as well as treatments aimed at restoring a deficient immune\n', '   response. Children with impaired IFN-g production, for example, are\n', '   prone to tuberculosis and benefit from IFN-g, whereas patients with\n', '   impaired IFN-a/b production are prone to herpes simplex encephalitis\n', '   and may benefit from IFN-a.\n', '\n', 'CAREER\n', '\n', '   Dr. Casanova received his M.D. from the University of Paris Descartes\n', '   in 1987.

Genetic studies in mice led to the identification of\n', '   leptin, a hormone made by fat tissue that plays a key role in\n', '   regulating weight. Current studies explore the mechanisms by which\n', '   leptin controls feeding behavior and body weight. Studies to identify\n', '   other key regulators are also under way.\n', '\n', '   Numerous lines of evidence have suggested that energy balance in\n', '   animals and humans is tightly controlled. With the identification of\n', '   leptin and its receptors by the Friedman laboratory, two of the\n', '   molecular components of a system that maintains constant weight have\n', '   been identified. Leptin is a hormone secreted by the adipose (fat)\n', '   tissue in proportion to its mass that in turn modulates food intake\n', '   relative to energy expenditure. Increased fat mass increases leptin\n', '   levels, which in turn reduces body weight; decreased fat mass leads to\n', '   a decrease in leptin levels and an increase in body weight. By this\n', '   mechanism, weight is maintained within a relatively narrow range.\n', '   Defects in the leptin gene are associated with severe obesity in\n', '   animals and in humans.\n', '\n', '   Leptin acts on sets of neurons in brain centers that control energy\n', '   balance to regulate appetite. Leptin also plays a general role in\n', '   regulating many of the physiologic responses that are observed with\n', '   changes in nutritional state, with clear effects on female\n', '   reproduction, immune function and the function of many other hormones,\n', '   including insulin.\n', '\n', '   Current research in the Friedman lab focuses on a series of questions\n', '   pertinent to the regulation of body weight: How does the fat cell\n', '   regulate how much leptin is made -- i.e., how does the fat cell know\n', '   how fat it is? How does a single molecule (leptin) change feeding, a\n', '   complex behavior? How do brain pathways that are modulated by leptin in\n', '   turn regulate peripheral metabolism and insulin action? Does variation\n', '   in the genes that compose the physiologic circuit of which leptin is a\n', '   component explain differences in body weight?\n', '\n', '   The recent identification of the hypothalamic cells that express the\n', '   leptin receptor is enabling Dr. Friedman and his colleagues to\n', '   delineate the precise neuronal effects of leptin and the mechanisms by\n', '   which this single molecule can alter a complex behavior. Recent studies\n', '   have revealed that leptin reduces food intake by decreasing the\n', '   pleasure associated with food. This finding suggests that the pleasure\n', '   derived from eating is not fixed but rather reflects the status of\n', '   metabolic signals.\n', '\n', '   The lab has also identified a specific neural population in the\n', '   hypothalamus that expresses a bioactive peptide known as MCH, which\n', '   plays key role in sensing the reward value of food. Ongoing studies\n', '   seek to understand how leptin modulates the activity of these neurons.\n', '   In addition, several new methods have also been developed for\n', '   identifying additional neural populations that regulate feeding. In the\n', '   first, a novel gene profiling technology can be used to define neural\n', '   populations whose activities are regulated by a stimulus. In the\n', '   second, gene profiling technology is used to define specific neural\n', '   populations based on their anatomic connections. Finally, the lab has\n', '   developed a new method for probing neural function using magnets or\n', '   radiowaves to remotely modulate the activity of specific neural\n', '   populations in vivo.\n', '\n', '   The Friedman lab is also studying the molecular mechanisms responsible\n', '   for changes of leptin gene expression associated with changes in fat\n', '   mass. The amount of leptin that is expressed from fat is strongly\n', '   regulated, with a more than 100-fold increase in expression from ob/ob\n', '   adipose tissue compared to adipose tissue of a lean or fasted animal,\n', '   suggesting that fat cells know how much fat they have and adjust leptin\n', '   expression accordingly. To identify the underlying mechanism\n', '   responsible for this regulation, Dr. Friedman and his colleagues are\n', '   using transgenic mice to identify DNA regulatory elements that change\n', '   expression of a reporter gene controlled by the leptin gene\n', '   proportionately with changes in adipose tissue mass. They have thus\n', '   modified a series of leptin bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)\n', '   clones so that the leptin DNA regulatory elements direct the expression\n', '   of luciferase. This has enabled the researchers to identify DNA\n', '   regulatory sequences that control leptin gene expression as well as\n', '   protein factors binding to these sequences. Studies to elucidate how\n', '   the activity of these factors changes, as fat is gained or lost, are\n', '   underway. Dr. Friedman hypothesizes that these studies will lead to the\n', '   identification of a novel lipid sensing signaling pathway in adipocytes\n', '   and possibly other cell types.\n', '\n', '   Leptin has potent metabolic effects to improve insulin action and\n', '   reduce the lipid content of peripheral tissues as retained and is now\n', '   an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of severe lipodystrophy, a form\n', '   of diabetes. The Friedman lab is studying the mechanism responsible for\n', "   leptin's antidiabetic function in this and other forms of diabetes.\n", '   Current data suggests that leptin interferes with both the production\n', '   and the action of glucagon, a hormone that acts to increase blood\n', '   glucose by opposing the effects of insulin. The cellular mechanisms\n', '   responsible for this are under investigation.\n', '\n', '   In collaboration with Tayfun Ozcelik at Bilkent University in Ankara,\n', '   Turkey, the Friedman lab is conducting studies of consanguineous\n', '   marriages that include patients who are either morbidly obese,\n', '   extremely lean or have polycystic ovary disease (PCOS), which is\n', '   associated with extreme resistance to insulin. Whole genome sequencing\n', '   is now underway on more than 50 families, with the expectation that\n', '   analyses of the DNA sequences from patients who are lean and obese will\n', '   reveal DNA mutations that contribute to differences in weight, or, in\n', '   other families, that lead to PCOS.\n', '\n', 'CAREER\n', '\n', '   Dr. Friedman graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and, in\n', '   1977 at the age of 22, received his M.D. from Albany Medical College of\n', '   Union University.

By identifying the genetic\n', '   components that cause immune system cells to respond to specific\n', '   antibodies, Dr. Ravetch hopes to gain a better understanding of how a\n', '   functioning immune system protects organisms from invaders, and how a\n', "   dysfunctional immune system attacks the body's own tissues.\n", '\n', '   The Ravetch laboratory analyzes systemic autoimmunity in mouse models\n', '   of certain diseases by investigating the genesis and fate of the\n', '   pathological antigen-antibody complexes that form and trigger tissue\n', '   damage. They simplify this complex problem by examining the mechanisms\n', '   through which immune complexes influence both the afferent and efferent\n', '   immune responses by interacting with a family of low-affinity surface\n', '   receptors, the Fc receptors. These receptors are expressed as pairs of\n', '   activation and inhibitory molecules, providing a mechanism for\n', '   establishing thresholds for cellular triggering and for terminating the\n', '   activation response. Disruptions of these pathways have revealed the\n', '   central role these receptors play in appropriate immune responses.\n', '\n', '   Dr. Ravetch has shown that inhibitory Fc receptors for immunoglobulin G\n', '   (IgG) are responsible for maintaining peripheral tolerance; animals\n', '   without inhibitory Fc receptors develop spontaneous autoimmunity and\n', '   autoimmune disease. Conversely, a deficiency of activation Fc receptors\n', '   results in a protective effect, in which mice susceptible to autoimmune\n', '   disease fail to develop it. But loss of activation receptors does not\n', '   alter the development of autoantibody and immune complex deposition.\n', '   Rather, Dr. Ravetch has found that these potentially pathogenic\n', '   complexes are unable to trigger effector cell responses and are\n', '   therefore benign. His lab is now investigating the precise cellular\n', '   pathways engaged by activation receptors via autoantibodies by\n', '   generating cell type-specific targeted gene disruptions of relevant\n', '   activation receptors and by identifying the downstream effector\n', '   molecules responsible. Recent work from the Ravetch lab showed that a\n', '   sugar attached to IgG antibodies confers their protective ability; they\n', '   are now working on a synthetic therapy rich in these sugar-linked\n', '   antibodies.\n', '\n', '   Another focus in the Ravetch lab is the circuits involved in\n', '   coordinating the regulation of activation and inhibitory receptors, in\n', '   order to determine the signals that shift the balance from inhibition\n', '   to activation. He has demonstrated that removing the inhibitory pathway\n', '   in vivo, for example, can dramatically increase the potency of a\n', '   cytotoxic antitumor antibody. This was the first demonstration of\n', '   antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity in vivo. Current studies are now\n', '   aimed at manipulating the inhibitory response to enhance or limit the\n', '   cytotoxicity of antibodies in vivo to better understand the role these\n', '   pathways play in protective immunity and their therapeutic potential.\n', '\n', '   The lab is also working to determine the pathways through which the\n', '   coupling of innate and adaptive mechanisms are coordinated to initiate\n', '   an immune response. Two such pathways are currently under\n', '   investigation: the feedback by immune complexes on antigen presentation\n', '   and the targeting of selected antigens to restricted follicular\n', '   locations to initiate T cell independent responses. Using a series of\n', '   mice deficient in specific Fc receptors and immune complexes designed\n', '   to selectively engage these pathways, they are determining the role of\n', '   each in activating or tolerizing presenting cells in vivo.\n', '\n', '   Work by Dr. Ravetch led to the cloning and mapping of the first\n', '   malarial parasite chromosome and more recently to the cloning of the\n', '   first Fc receptor genes. He discovered how immunoglobulin receptors\n', '   mediate antibody-triggered inflammation and determined the mechanism by\n', '   which intravenous immunoglobulin causes immunosuppression. He also\n', '   played a key role in establishing Fc receptor pathways as an essential\n', '   part of the immune response and in describing the mechanisms of\n', '   antibody-mediated effector responses.\n', '\n', 'CAREER\n', '\n', '   Dr. Ravetch graduated from Yale University in 1973 and received his\n', '   Ph.D. in 1978 from The Rockefeller University, where he studied under\n', '   Norton Zinder and Peter Model.

To\n', '   identify the genes responsible for recessive disorders, Dr. Gleeson\n', '   recruits patients in regions of the world where marriage within\n', '   extended families is relatively common, simplifying the search for\n', '   inherited mutations. Ultimately, these results also contribute to the\n', '   understanding of human brain development.\n', '\n', '   Understanding the causes of brain disorders, particularly among\n', '   children, presents unique challenges. The brain is less accessible than\n', '   other organs; typical screening tests, such as magnetic resonance\n', '   imaging, are not as predictive as once thought; and it has become\n', '   apparent that multiple mutations may, individually, cause the same\n', '   disorder, while any given mutation may lead to many different clinical\n', '   presentations.\n', '\n', '   Genetic sequencing technology allows researchers to look across all\n', '   possible genes for a culprit, without introducing any bias based on\n', '   preconceptions about the disorder. Dr. Gleeson uses high throughput\n', '   exome sequencing to investigate the causes of pediatric brain\n', '   disorders, often among children in highly susceptible families. The\n', '   results have implications for not only the diagnosis, but also the\n', "   treatment of patients. And the discoveries also support Dr. Gleeson's\n", '   overarching goal: to better understand the development of the human\n', '   brain.\n', '\n', "   Dr. Gleeson's work originally focused on Joubert syndrome and double\n", '   cortex syndrome. Joubert syndrome is an inherited malformation of the\n', '   cerebellum and brain stem. The laboratory established Joubert syndrome\n', '   as one of the ciliopathies, disorders due to defects in the function of\n', '   neuronal primary cilia. The Gleeson lab established more than six\n', '   different genetic causes and is currently investigating the mechanisms\n', '   by which the disorder arises. He also identified the cause for double\n', '   cortex syndrome, which is due to mutations in the doublecortin gene\n', '   that cause defects in migration of neurons to the cerebral cortex. As\n', '   the tools for gene sequencing have improved, he has expanded his focus\n', '   to encompass a spectrum of devastating childhood neurological\n', '   disorders, including autism, epilepsy, intellectual disability and\n', '   structural disorders.\n', '\n', '   Because disorders caused by single-gene mutations are extremely scarce\n', '   within the general population, Dr. Gleeson collaborates with\n', '   physician-scientists in the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia,\n', '   where consanguineous marriage between relatives as close as first\n', '   cousins is common, to recruit affected families. In these families, two\n', '   unaffected parents often produce more than one affected child. Using\n', '   samples from these families, the Gleeson laboratory identifies likely\n', '   variations and builds a model, using stem cells, mice, cell biology or\n', '   biochemistry-based methods, to predict the mechanism responsible.\n', '\n', '   To date, the Gleeson laboratory has enrolled more than 3,000 families\n', '   and examined more than 4,000 exomes, the largest single-lab experience\n', '   in the U.S. From the growing candidate gene list, the lab prioritizes\n', '   candidate genes that suggest possible treatments, often for conditions\n', '   thought to be untreatable. In recent work, the Gleason lab identified a\n', '   rare form of autism that involves epileptic seizures and intellectual\n', '   deficits in three Middle Eastern families, and pinpointed its cause to\n', '   be a mutation in the gene BCKDK. This mutation blocks the action of an\n', '   enzyme that prevents the metabolism of essential branched-chain amino\n', '   acids. Recent work points to the effectiveness of treatment with\n', '   dietary branched-chain amino acids to treat this form of autism and\n', '   epilepsy.\n', '\n', '   Currently, most diagnostic sequencing is limited to the exome, the\n', '   small portion of the genome containing DNA that codes for protein.\n', '   However, Dr. Gleeson and others intend to use the uniquely accessible\n', '   genetics of consanguineous families to help make sense of the rest of\n', '   the genome, its so-called dark matter, and to transition to\n', '   whole-genome sequencing, in collaboration with the New York Genome\n', '   Center.\n', '\n', '   With the dual goals of improving diagnosis and redefining disorders\n', '   based on their genetic causes, rather than their symptoms, Dr. Gleeson\n', '   also hopes to form collaborations with neurodevelopmental specialists\n', "   in New York City in order to obtain sequences of patients' genomes\n", '   early on during the diagnostic process.\n', '\n', 'CAREER\n', '\n', "   Dr. Gleeson received his bachelor's degree in chemistry from the\n", '   University of California, San Diego, in 1986 and earned his medical\n', "   degree in 1991 from the University of Chicago's Pritzker School of\n", '   Medicine with honors.

Matter in all its forms, from stars to living\n', '   organisms, can be described in terms of 12 fundamental particles, six\n', '   quarks and six leptons, interacting among themselves by exchanging\n', '   force particles -- gluons, photons or W and Z bosons -- following\n', '   strict mathematical rules based on symmetry principles.\n', '\n', "   Founded in 1970, Dr. Goulianos's laboratory has made substantial\n", '   contributions to establishing the Standard Model as the premier theory\n', '   of particle physics. Their experiments at the Intersecting Storage\n', '   Rings at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, provided\n', '   early evidence for the existence of quarks through the measurement of\n', '   high transverse momentum particle production. In experiments at the\n', '   Brookhaven National Laboratory, they discovered and measured the rate\n', '   of neutrino-proton elastic scattering, confirming the neutral-current\n', '   interactions predicted by the Standard Model. And using the Fermilab\n', '   Tevatron, the Goulianos laboratory contributed to the discovery of the\n', '   top quark. Despite its phenomenal predictive power, the Standard Model\n', '   is far from the "theory of everything." It does not incorporate gravity\n', '   and has no obvious explanation for dark matter or dark energy, of which\n', '   most of the universe is made. The ultimate theory, the "DNA of nature,"\n', '   is still at large.\n', '\n', '   Using data collected by the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) at the\n', '   proton-antiproton Tevatron collider, Dr. Goulianos and his colleagues\n', '   have been performing searches for the Higgs particle, the quantum of\n', '   the field that could explain the diversity of quark masses; for\n', '   supersymmetry and extra dimensions, theoretical ideas aimed at\n', '   accommodating gravity and explaining dark matter and dark energy; and\n', '   studying diffractive phenomena. The latter provide a window to\n', '   nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics, a component of the Standard\n', '   Model important for understanding the structure of strongly interacting\n', '   particles like the proton.

The LHC was completed and\n', "   commissioned in the fall of 2009 as the world's largest particle\n", '   accelerator. More than 330 papers have been published by CMS\n', '   collaborators in refereed journals. The accelerator has reached an\n', '   energy level four times higher than the Tevatron, which increased the\n', '   discovery potential for new physics within and beyond the Standard\n', '   Model. Team members have been working on measuring the energies of jets\n', '   (the streams of particles that are emitted when quarks or gluons\n', '   interact) and developing statistical techniques. Measuring the\n', '   directions and energies of the particles in a jet allows scientists to,\n', "   for instance, differentiate the Higgs's mass from its decay products,\n", '   while statistical techniques help optimize the data analysis. On July\n', '   4, 2012, the CMS and ATLAS experiments announced the discovery of a new\n', '   particle of mass around 125 billion electron volts with properties\n', '   consistent with those expected for the Higgs.

Working with Drosophila melanogaster\n', "   flies, mosquitoes and human subjects, Dr. Vosshall's research has\n", '   yielded new knowledge about how odor stimuli are processed and\n', '   perceived.\n', '\n', "   Dr. Vosshall's lab takes a multidisciplinary approach spanning cell\n", '   biology, genetics, neurobiology and behavior. The early focus of the\n', '   lab has been to study how the brain interprets olfactory signals in the\n', '   environment that signal food, danger or potential mating partners. The\n', '   group has been studying these problems in three model organisms: the\n', '   fly, the mosquito and the human. The majority of the early work in the\n', '   laboratory was carried out in the genetically tractable vinegar fly,\n', '   Drosophila melanogaster, which displays a rich repertoire of\n', '   chemosensory behaviors despite having a nervous system with only\n', '   100,000 neurons. In this animal, the Vosshall lab studied the\n', '   functional neuroanatomy of the olfactory system, how this system\n', '   perceives sex pheromones and the structure and function of the insect\n', '   odorant receptors.\n', '\n', '   The Vosshall lab identified the genes that mediate odor and carbon\n', '   dioxide perception in insects. One member of the odorant gene family,\n', '   Orco, is of particular interest to the Vosshall lab, as it is unique in\n', '   being expressed in nearly all olfactory neurons and is highly conserved\n', "   across insect evolution. Dr. Vosshall's lab has shown that Orco\n", '   functions as a coreceptor, working in tandem with odorant receptors in\n', '   the dendrites of olfactory neurons, and has pinpointed this protein as\n', '   a potential target for chemical inhibitors, which may help fight\n', '   mosquito-transmitted infectious diseases.\n', '\n', '   The group has recently expanded its research focus to establish a\n', '   mosquito genetics research program to understand host-seeking and\n', '   blood-feeding behavior in the mosquito. The Vosshall lab studies the\n', '   malaria mosquito (Anopheles gambiae) and the yellow fever mosquito\n', '   (Aedes aegypti), which have both evolved an intense attraction to human\n', '   body odor and carbon dioxide -- the gas humans exhale -- and thus serve\n', '   as deadly vectors of infectious disease. Olfactory cues guide\n', '   mosquitoes toward humans, from which the mosquitoes derive the blood\n', '   they need to complete ovarian development. To shed new light on\n', '   mosquito olfaction and host-seeking behavior, the Vosshall lab has\n', '   developed genome editing techniques for targeted mutagenesis in A.\n', '   aegypti using zinc-finger nucleases, TALENs and the CRISPR/Cas9 system.\n', '   The establishment of loss-of-function genetics in mosquitoes has opened\n', '   up new paths of investigation in vector biology, including the\n', '   neurobiology of host seeking.\n', '\n', '   Another broad area of interest is olfactory perception in humans. The\n', '   Rockefeller University Smell Study, directed by research associate\n', '   Andreas Keller, has been carrying out large-scale research on human\n', '   subjects to combine olfactory psychophysics with genetic analysis in\n', '   order to understand the mechanisms of olfactory perception in humans.\n', '   Recent work has challenged the assumption that humans have a\n', '   comparatively poor sense of smell compared to animals and led to the\n', '   finding that the human nose has the power to discriminate between a\n', '   very large number of olfactory stimuli. Ongoing work aims to link\n', '   variation in olfactory perception to genetic polymorphisms, to probe\n', '   the basic perceptual logic of human smell and to develop clinical\n', '   interventions for patients suffering from olfactory dysfunction.\n', '\n', 'CAREER\n', '\n', '   Dr. Vosshall received her undergraduate degree in biochemistry from\n', '   Columbia University in 1987 and her Ph.D. from The Rockefeller\n', '   University in 1993.

In many bacteria\n', '   and most archaea, clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic\n', '   repeats (CRISPRs) specify a recently discovered genetic interference\n', '   pathway that protects cells from viruses (phages) and conjugative\n', '   plasmids. Within CRISPR sequences, the repeats are separated by short\n', '   spacer sequences that match phage or plasmid genomes and specify the\n', '   targets of interference. Spacer sequences are transcribed into CRISPR\n', '   RNAs (crRNAs) -- small RNAs that, through base-pairing interactions\n', '   with the target sequence, guide Cas nucleases to the invasive nucleic\n', '   acid. Upon infection, CRISPR arrays can acquire new repeat-spacer units\n', '   that match the infecting phage or plasmid. Therefore, CRISPR-Cas\n', '   systems provide adaptive and inheritable immunity to the bacterial\n', '   cell. The spacer content of CRISPR arrays reflects the many different\n', '   invaders encountered by the host and can be expanded rapidly in\n', '   response to new ones.

Konarska\n', '\n', '   The first step in the synthesis of proteins is transcription of RNA.\n', '   But in all eukaryotes, between the time when RNA is made and when it is\n', '   translated into proteins, it often undergoes a process called splicing,\n', '   when certain parts of the RNA (called introns) are cut out and the\n', '   remaining sequences (called exons) are joined back together. How RNA\n', '   splicing occurs, and the interplay between splicing and transcription,\n', "   is the subject of Dr. Konarska's research.\n", '\n', '   Using a combination of yeast genetics and biochemistry, Dr. Konarska is\n', '   interested in what happens to messenger RNA before and as it is\n', '   spliced. More specifically, her laboratory is interested in how the\n', '   spliceosome (the large complex responsible for splicing catalysis,\n', '   composed of hundreds of proteins and five small RNA molecules) is\n', '   formed and how it functions; i.e., what happens at the catalytic center\n', '   of the spliceosome during the removal of introns. Dr. Konarska also\n', '   examines the connection between RNA transcription and splicing.\n', '\n', '   Multiple interactions between the different proteins and RNAs of the\n', '   spliceosome are important for creating an active catalytic site for\n', '   splicing. The splicing process requires a series of conformational\n', '   rearrangements of the spliceosome that affect its assembly, catalysis\n', '   and disassembly. In collaboration with Charles Query at the Albert\n', '   Einstein College of Medicine, Dr. Konarska has recently formulated a\n', '   two-state model of spliceosome function, according to which structural\n', '   conformations that define the two catalytic steps exist in competition\n', '   with one another. This model suggests remarkable similarities between\n', '   the mechanism of function of the ribosome (another large\n', '   ribonucleoprotein complex, which catalyzes protein synthesis) and the\n', '   spliceosome. In both cases, equilibrium between conformational states\n', '   can be modulated by many factors, including, but not limited to,\n', '   specific contacts between the RNA substrate and the enzyme.\n', '\n', '   The spliceosome is able to act on suboptimal splice sites, especially\n', '   in higher eukaryotes, but to an extent also in yeast. According to the\n', '   two-state model of spliceosome function, selection of suboptimal sites\n', '   may be improved by many factors that modulate the relative stabilities\n', '   of conformational states of the spliceosome. Many mutated forms of\n', '   various spliceosomal proteins affect splicing in this way, as may\n', '   alternative splicing factors that improve splicing of certain entire\n', '   classes of introns. A separate project in the lab looks at other\n', '   molecules (RNA or small chemical molecules) that stabilize specific\n', '   conformations of the spliceosome. These molecules would functionally\n', '   resemble ribosomal antibiotics that inhibit translation by binding to\n', '   the ribosome and stabilizing one of the two alternative conformations.\n', '   Once identified, such "splicing antibiotics" would provide tools for\n', '   biochemical and structural studies of the spliceosome and may have\n', '   therapeutic applications.\n', '\n', "   Although Dr. Konarska's research addresses the basic function of the\n", '   spliceosome and the mechanism of splicing catalysis in yeast, these\n', '   findings elucidate general properties of splicing in all eukaryotes,\n', '   including humans. Therefore, these results help scientists understand\n', '   not only the splicing of canonical introns, but also of those that\n', '   undergo the alternative splicing typical of mammalian cells. In this\n', "   way, Dr. Konarska's research may help uncover the etiology of multiple\n", '   genetic disorders resulting from changes in alternative splicing\n', '   patterns of specific gene transcripts. In addition, a better\n', '   understanding of RNA splicing may shed light on the origins of life, as\n', '   some models propose that the earliest organisms used RNA or an RNA-like\n', '   molecule rather than DNA as their genetic material.\n', '\n', 'CAREER\n', '\n', '   Dr. Konarska was born in Poland and received her M.Sc. in genetics from\n', '   the University of Warsaw in 1979.

Duplication of the chromosomes, however,\n', '   requires numerous proteins acting together to unwind and replicate the\n', "   two strands of duplex DNA. Dr. O'Donnell's laboratory studies these\n", '   replication mechanisms with the goal of understanding how the protein\n', '   gears act together to make copies of DNA and how they function with\n', '   repair and recombination factors to ensure that those copies are\n', '   accurate.\n', '\n', "   Over the years, research from Dr. O'Donnell's lab has provided an\n", '   overview of how the replication machine functions in Escherichia coli,\n', '   and several of its features have been found to be common to yeast and\n', '   humans. A circular protein, which he and his colleagues refer to as a\n', '   sliding clamp, completely encircles duplex DNA, acting as a mobile\n', '   tether to hold the replication machine to the chromosome as it\n', '   functions. The sliding clamps of prokaryote (b) and eukaryote\n', '   proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) have similar structure and\n', "   function. Dr. O'Donnell solved the structures of these ring-shaped\n", "   proteins in collaboration with John Kuriyan's laboratory (now at the\n", '   University of California, Berkeley) and showed that they comprise six\n', '   domains organized on a dimer or trimer surface. Once on DNA, the clamp\n', '   binds the replication machinery and slides along behind it, constantly\n', '   holding it to the chromosome for long distances.\n', '\n', '   To become attached to DNA, sliding clamps require a multiprotein clamp\n', '   loader machine that uses adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to open the\n', '   circular clamp and place it onto DNA. The detailed workings of how\n', "   these clamp loaders function have been one of the lab's aims in both\n", '   prokaryotic (g complex) and eukaryotic (RF-C) systems. Biochemical\n', "   studies by Dr. O'Donnell's group, combined with crystal structure\n", "   information from Dr. Kuriyan's laboratory, show that these clamp\n", '   loaders are circular heteropentamers of crescent-shaped subunits that\n', '   act like a hand with fingers; ATP binding powers the hand to manipulate\n', '   the ring-shaped clamp onto DNA, and ATP hydrolysis allows the ring to\n', '   close. Understanding the process by which two DNA polymerases cooperate\n', '   with one clamp loader and a hexameric ring-shaped helicase to\n', '   simultaneously synthesize both strands of duplex DNA is a project that\n', "   has also held Dr. O'Donnell's fascination over the past few years. He\n", '   and his colleagues have learned about three point switches between\n', '   primase, the clamp loader and DNA polymerase and the processes by which\n', '   sliding clamps are recycled and regulated.\n', '\n', '   New and recent studies into other, accompanying processes include how\n', '   the replication machinery interfaces with proteins in repair, DNA\n', '   damage checkpoint paths and recombination. For example, the sliding\n', "   clamps interact directly with MutS and MutL, and the O'Donnell lab is\n", '   studying how it functions in mismatch repair. The b and PCNA clamps\n', '   also bind several other proteins, indicating that these clamps and\n', '   clamp loaders are at the center of many DNA metabolic processes. Dr.\n', "   O'Donnell's lab is initiating a project on the role of these proteins\n", '   in recombinative repair in which the replication fork encounters a\n', '   lesion that must be fixed by recombination and repair proteins.\n', '   Scientists had widely anticipated that a replication fork would\n', "   collapse upon encountering a lesion, but Dr. O'Donnell's group found\n", '   that this is not the case. Instead, blocks on the lagging strand are\n', '   bypassed entirely by the replication machinery. Furthermore, the\n', '   replication fork helicase itself is capable of encircling either one of\n', '   two strands, and in the latter mode it is capable of branch migration\n', '   of Holliday junctions, making it a likely candidate as a central actor\n', '   in recombinative repair of a stalled replication fork.\n', '\n', "   The O'Donnell lab is also studying how replication origins are\n", '   activated for DNA synthesis, with the expectation that studies in the\n', '   yeast system will lead to information on the overall control of\n', '   chromosome replication.\n', '\n', 'CAREER\n', '\n', "   Dr. O'Donnell received his Ph.D. at the University of Michigan, where\n", '   he worked under Charles Williams Jr. on electron transfer in the\n', '   flavoprotein thioredoxin reductase.

His\n', "   lab's findings have implications for sleep and mood disorders as well\n", '   as dysfunctions related to the timing of gene activities underlying\n', '   visual functions, locomotion, metabolism, immunity, learning and\n', '   memory.\n', '\n', '   Studies of the molecular basis for circadian rhythmicity began in the\n', "   early 1980s in Young's laboratory at Rockefeller, and in the\n", '   laboratories of Jeffrey Hall and Michael Rosbash at Brandeis\n', '   University. Over the past 30 years the work of these investigators,\n', '   which focused on the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, has shown that\n', "   the fly's circadian clocks are formed through the actions of a small\n", '   group of genes\n', '   including per (period), tim (timeless), dbt (double-time, casein kinase\n', '   1), clk (clock), cyc (cycle), sgg(shaggy), Pdp1 (PAR domain protein\n', '   1), vri (vrille), cry  (cryptochrome) and ck2 (casein kinase 2). Six of\n', '   these genes were first characterized in the Young laboratory, and\n', '   mutations in any of these "clock" genes can lengthen or shorten the\n', '   period of behavioral, physiological and molecular circadian rhythms, or\n', '   can abolish the rhythms altogether.\n', '\n', '   The abundance of per, tim, vri, Pdp1 and clk RNA and their encoded\n', '   proteins changes rhythmically with a circadian period in wild-type\n', '   flies. In addition to these RNA and protein rhythms, two of\n', '   the proteins, TIM and PER, rhythmically shift their sub-cellular\n', '   location. Young and his colleagues found that these two proteins\n', "   accumulate, pair up in the cell's cytoplasm and then migrate into the\n", '   nucleus, where their presence switches off their production by shutting\n', '   down the per and tim genes. However, these events are timed so that PER\n', '   and TIM are retained in the cytoplasm for a fixed interval of several\n', '   hours. This delay promotes RNA and protein rhythms and determines the\n', '   period of the clock.\n', '\n', '   The circadian clock adjusts to environmental photo-cycles through the\n', '   activities of CRY and TIM. The former protein is a novel photoreceptor\n', "   that binds to TIM in the presence of light and promotes TIM's rapid\n", '   degradation, pausing the clock until TIM can re-accumulate in the dark.\n', "    Young's laboratory also discovered that the enzyme casein kinase 1\n", '   (DBT) further regulates the pace of this 24-hour molecular clock by\n', '   restricting the longevity of the PER protein during each circadian\n', '   cycle, and especially by removing PER at times when TIM is absent.\n', '   Others have recently shown that faulty interactions between casein\n', '   kinase 1 and PER are responsible for certain heritable sleep disorders\n', '   in humans. In fact, most of the genes composing the Drosophila clock,\n', '   and the cycling intracellular mechanism they direct, are well conserved\n', '   throughout the animal kingdom.\n', '\n', '   The Young laboratory has used oligonucleotide microarrays that\n', '   represent all 14,000 fly genes to study the gene expression programs\n', '   regulated by the circadian clock. They have found that in\n', '   the Drosophila head, approximately 400 to 500 genes -- about six to\n', '   seven percent of all genes active in the head -- are expressed with a\n', '   circadian rhythm. Genes composing this large circadian program\n', "   influence almost every aspect of the fly's biology, and subsets of\n", '   these genes are switched on and off with phases representing every hour\n', '   of the day and night. When genes that compose the circadian clock are\n', '   mutated, this program of temporally sequenced gene expression\n', '   disappears even if environmental cycles are present, indicating that\n', '   the temporal program is thoroughly dependent on the molecular\n', '   oscillator.\n', '\n', '   Recently members of the Young laboratory have identified genes that\n', '   affect the homeostatic regulation of sleep in Drosophila. This research\n', '   has uncovered specific neurons whose activity promotes sleep. They have\n', '   also begun to study sleep and circadian rhythms at the genetic and\n', '   molecular levels in humans. The latter work involves collaborative\n', '   studies of circadian behavioral and physiological rhythms that are\n', '   coupled to studies in the Young laboratory that assess rhythmic gene\n', '   and protein activities established in cultured cells derived from\n', '   patients with certain sleep and depressive disorders.\n', '\n', 'CAREER\n', '\n', '   Dr. Young received his undergraduate degree in biology in 1971 and his\n', '   Ph.D. in genetics in 1975, both from The University of Texas, Austin.\n', '   Following postdoctoral work in biochemistry at the Stanford University\n', '   School of Medicine, he was appointed assistant professor at Rockefeller\n', '   in 1978 as part of The Rockefeller University Fellows Program.

Although this places a limit on\n', "   classical genetic analysis, Dr. Nussenzweig's laboratory circumvents\n", '   the problem by combining biochemistry and molecular biology with gene\n', '   targeting and transgenic technologies to better understand the\n', '   molecular aspects of adaptive and innate immune responses. He focuses\n', '   on B lymphocytes and antibodies for adaptive immunity and on dendritic\n', '   cells in his studies of innate immunity.\n', '\n', '   The function of the immune system is to protect vertebrates from a\n', '   multitude of different pathogens, and there are two types of immune\n', '   responses that have evolved to accomplish this task: innate and\n', '   adaptive immunity. Lymphocytes are the primary effectors of adaptive\n', '   immunity and assemble a diverse repertoire of immune receptors using a\n', '   somatic gene recombination process known as V(D)J recombination. This\n', '   process enables the production of a very large number of unique\n', '   receptors that are able to recognize almost any antigen, but it also\n', '   produces self-reactive receptors, which must be silenced to prevent\n', '   autoimmune diseases.\n', '\n', '   A series of checkpoints has evolved to ensure that B cells emerging\n', '   from the bone marrow carry functional and non-self-reactive antigen\n', "   receptors. Dr. Nussenzweig's laboratory has examined the regulation of\n", '   these checkpoints and found that many depend on signals from membrane\n', '   immunoglobulin. In its absence, B cells fail to pass the checkpoints\n', '   and die by apoptosis. Ongoing research focuses on understanding\n', '   checkpoint regulation, the mechanisms that veto autoimmune antibody\n', '   production and how this breaks down in autoimmune diseases.\n', '\n', '   Although V(D)J recombination produces a multitude of antigen receptors,\n', '   they are relatively low-affinity receptors that must be refined by\n', '   somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination to produce the\n', '   high-affinity antibodies that protect against most pathogens. The lab\n', '   is investigating the molecular basis of these diversification reactions\n', '   and how they can occasionally lead to cancer-associated chromosome\n', '   translocations.\n', '\n', '   A second area of interest for the Nussenzweig lab is the physiological\n', '   function of dendritic cells. To examine the function of dendritic cells\n', '   in the steady state, he and his colleagues devised an in vivo antigen\n', '   delivery system that uses a monoclonal antibody and a dendritic\n', '   cell-restricted endocytic receptor, DEC-205. This route of antigen\n', '   delivery is several orders of magnitude more efficient in inducing T\n', '   cell activation and cell division than free peptide in strong\n', '   adjuvants. But the activation response is not sustained, and T cells\n', '   become unresponsive to systemic rechallenge with antigen. Coinjection\n', '   with anti-CD40 agonistic antibody changes the outcome from tolerance to\n', '   prolonged T cell activation and immunity, indicating that in the steady\n', '   state, the primary function of dendritic cells is to maintain\n', '   peripheral tolerance.\n', '\n', "   Dr. Nussenzweig's experiments are consistent with the notion that\n", '   self-antigens induce tolerance. In contrast, antigens taken up by\n', '   dendritic cells in the context of activation stimuli, such as those\n', '   found during inflammation or tissue destruction, induce prolonged T\n', '   cell activation. This steady-state tolerizing function of dendritic\n', '   cells may be essential to their role in eliciting immunity. During\n', '   inflammation or infection, they present self-antigens simultaneously\n', '   with non-self-antigens. By establishing tolerance to self-antigens\n', '   before challenge with pathogens, dendritic cells can focus the adaptive\n', '   immune system entirely on the pathogen, thereby avoiding autoimmunity.\n', '   The ability to target antigens to dendritic cells and control their\n', '   function in vivo has significant implications for the development of\n', '   vaccines and therapies for autoimmunity. Recently, the lab defined\n', '   distinct progenitor lineages for classical spleen dendritic cells,\n', '   plasmacytoid dendritic cells and monocytes, a useful step toward\n', '   antigen-specific targeting.\n', '\n', 'CAREER\n', '\n', "   Dr. Nussenzweig received his bachelor's degree from New York University\n", '   in 1975.

Dr. Feigenbaum's laboratory helped establish the field of\n", '   chaotic dynamics, which seeks the understanding of just such phenomena.\n', '   Its overall thrust is to enlarge the applicability of mathematics to\n', '   science.\n', '\n', '   Dr. Feigenbaum is a pioneer in the science of "chaos," the mathematics\n', '   of erratic dynamical systems -- objects with unpredictable behavior and\n', '   an attendant "fractal" geometry.\n', '\n', '   Chaotic motion shows a lack of predictability despite the total absence\n', '   of any random ingredients. While the various constraints on a system,\n', '   such as bounded resources, can allow it to move regularly on a smooth\n', '   space, its chaotic motion lies in a highly complicated subspace -- a\n', '   so-called "strange attractor." Using computers and inventing\n', '   mathematics, Dr. Feigenbaum erected a full, precise mathematical\n', '   description of systems during their transition from order to disorder\n', '   -- for example, a dripping faucet changing from a steady drip into an\n', '   erratic one. The mathematics that underlies this changeover holds true\n', '   for all systems undergoing this "period doubling" onset of chaos, with\n', "   all scaling details identically independent of a system's precise\n", '   nature, including fluctuating animal populations, electrical signals in\n', '   circuits, lasers and various chemical reactions. Dr. Feigenbaum has\n', '   shown that all these phenomena prominently exhibit numbers determined\n', '   by his theory, for example 4.6692016..., a constant of nature called\n', '   "Feigenbaum\'s constant," determining the rate of onset.\n', '\n', '   A fractal is a complex object built hierarchically of finer and finer\n', '   details, all similar apart from their successively reduced scales.\n', '   These intricate formations in space, reminiscent of objects such as\n', '   mountains and snowflakes, as well as complex formations in time, can be\n', '   described by mathematical rules, discovered by Dr. Feigenbaum, called\n', '   "scaling functions." Scaling functions describe the evolution of an\n', '   object, whatever its current form or size, and so, unchanged,  can be\n', '   repeatedly reapplied.\n', '\n', '   In this circumstance, the object produced is scale invariant, meaning\n', '   that as it evolves from a given size, its details remain loosely\n', '   proportional to that size, and so, fractal.

The\n', '   Heintz laboratory, in collaboration with Paul Greengard, developed the\n', '   translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) technique.

Dr.\n', "   Papavasiliou's research focuses on the different molecular processes\n", '   that cells and organisms employ to diversify and expand the information\n', '   encoded in their genomes.\n', '\n', '   Using a combination of biochemistry and genetics, Dr. Papavasiliou is\n', '   studying the molecular basis of the specific type of DNA mutation that\n', '   underlies the diversification of antibodies in the B lymphocytes of the\n', '   immune system. When B cells, specialized cells that produce antibodies\n', '   against foreign molecules, encounter an antigen, mutations are\n', '   introduced in the genes of their B cell receptors that recognize that\n', '   antigen. This hypermutation process helps some of those B cells to\n', '   acquire a higher affinity for the antigen, and those cells then become\n', '   selected for survival; i.e., the immune system selects the B cells that\n', '   are the best candidates for long-term memory against the antigen.\n', '   Without somatic hypermutation, an individual may become\n', '   immunocompromised in the ability to deal with antigens.\n', '\n', '   Hypermutation in B cells is dependent on a protein called\n', '   activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). When AID is expressed in\n', '   these cells, it changes cytidine residues in the DNA to uracil, which\n', '   is then recognized as DNA damage. Normally, the cell repairs uracil\n', '   lesions by properly converting them back to cytidine; somehow, in B\n', '   cells, the damaged antibody genes are misrepaired, such that the uracil\n', '   lesion is converted to thymidine. How AID targets antibody genes for\n', '   deamination and why uracil lesions in antibody genes are misrepaired,\n', '   even though they are properly repaired in all other contexts, are\n', '   questions under investigation in the Papavasiliou lab.\n', '\n', '   B cells use DNA mutation to diversify and expand their antibody\n', '   repertoire, which they need to block entry and eventually remove\n', '   pathogens. Other organisms use DNA recombination to diversify their\n', '   surface receptors and specifically evade antibody recognition. For\n', '   instance, surface antigen variation in parasites like the African\n', '   trypanosome (Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of sleeping\n', '   sickness) is generated by gene conversion between silent cassettes and\n', '   one active expression site. Understanding the mechanism that initiates\n', '   targeted gene conversion in these parasites is an active area of\n', "   interest in the lab (and an ongoing collaboration with Rockefeller's\n", '   George A.M. Cross).\n', '\n', '   AID belongs to the AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminase enzymes,\n', '   most of which deaminate DNA to initiate DNA mutation. One of these,\n', '   however, the APOBEC-1 deaminase, functions not as a DNA mutator but as\n', '   an RNA "editor." Using transcriptome-wide binary comparisons between a\n', '   genomic DNA sequence and the sequence of its RNA transcript, the\n', '   Papavasiliou lab has uncovered multiple instances of APOBEC-1 editing\n', '   that resulted in C-to-U changes in the edited transcript (noted as\n', '   C-to-T differences between genomic DNA and messenger RNA), which\n', '   effectively reprogram gene expression. The lab is keenly interested in\n', '   further understanding the functional relevance of these changes at the\n', '   organismal level.\n', '\n', '   Finally, these genome/transcriptome comparisons have revealed a\n', '   multitude of RNA/DNA alterations that occur at high frequency but\n', '   cannot be attributed to cytidine deamination. These occur both in\n', '   coding regions and in regulatory regions, and the lab is currently\n', '   devising methods to first catalog these and to then characterize them\n', '   functionally.

Dr. Bieniasz seeks to define how host gene products influence\n', '   the replication of retroviruses, with an emphasis on human and primate\n', '   immunodeficiency viruses. There are two dominant research areas in his\n', '   lab: characterizing the host-cell factors and pathways that are\n', '   mimicked, manipulated and otherwise exploited by retroviruses, and\n', '   studying host functions that have evolved specifically to defend cells\n', '   against retrovirus infection.\n', '\n', "   One major focus of Dr. Bieniasz's lab is determining how retrovirus\n", '   structural proteins are transported, assembled and released from cells\n', '   as infectious particles. The role of host factors and pathways in these\n', '   processes has been one of the most enigmatic areas in retrovirology,\n', '   but one that is gradually becoming clearer. For example, Dr. Bieniasz\n', '   has shown that many enveloped viruses -- retroviruses included --\n', '   specifically recruit components of a cellular pathway that normally\n', '   mediates the budding of vesicles into the lumen of endosomes. Dr.\n', '   Bieniasz found that viral proteins redirect vesicle budding and\n', '   ubiquitin ligation machinery to sites of virus assembly in order to\n', '   facilitate the formation of an enveloped virus particle. Other related\n', '   problems that the lab is investigating include defining how retroviral\n', "   proteins select the locations within the cell at which they're\n", '   assembled; in particular, how they are affected by the cellular\n', '   environment and host molecules as well as the intrinsic membrane\n', '   binding and multimerizing properties of retroviral Gag proteins.\n', '\n', '   A second major area of interest is "intrinsic immunity." Evolution has\n', '   equipped mammals with several gene products specifically to prevent or\n', '   attenuate retrovirus replication. Intrinsic immunity differs from\n', "   classical innate immunity in that it doesn't seem to require any form\n", '   of signaling or intercellular communication to be activated. Rather, it\n', '   apparently consists of constitutively expressed intracellular proteins\n', '   that exhibit potent antiretroviral activity. Dr. Bieniasz works on\n', '   three classes of inhibitors. One class (exemplified by Fv1 and TRIM5)\n', '   blocks infection by targeting incoming retrovirus capsids. Prior\n', '   research by Dr. Bieniasz has shown that this class of inhibitors\n', '   prevents HIV-1 infection in cells from some nonhuman primates. The\n', '   human version of this inhibitor protects against some retroviruses, but\n', '   not HIV. A second class is comprised of cytidine deaminases (such as\n', '   APOBEC3G) that induce lethal hypermutation of retroviral genomes.\n', '\n', '   Recently, research from the Bieniasz lab has identified a third type of\n', '   antiviral molecule, called tetherin, that prevents virus particles from\n', '   being released from the cell surface and moving off to infect other\n', '   cells. Dr. Bieniasz has also found that HIV uses another protein,\n', '   called Vpu, to counteract tetherin and allow budding virus particles to\n', '   depart from the cell surface.\n', '\n', '   Understanding how these cellular antiretroviral activities work and how\n', '   some retroviruses, particularly primate immunodeficiency viruses, have\n', '   acquired new functions that confer resistance to them could provide new\n', '   opportunities to develop novel therapies and improved animal models of\n', '   AIDS. To that end, the Bieniasz lab recently developed a strain of\n', '   HIV-1 that can infect pig-tailed macaques. The virus differs from that\n', "   found in humans by a single gene that protects it from the monkey's\n", '   APOBEC3 inhibitors. With further work, the new strain, dubbed simian\n', '   tropic HIV-1, could provide a reliable animal model for testing HIV\n', '   vaccines and other treatments.\n', '\n', 'CAREER\n', '\n', '   Dr. Bieniasz received his undergraduate degree in biochemistry from the\n', '   University of Bath in 1990 and his Ph.D. in virology from Imperial\n', '   College, University of London, in 1996.

As a\n', '   physician-scientist focusing on obesity and metabolic disease, Dr.\n', '   Cohen investigates the molecular origins of metabolic dysfunction\n', '   related to obesity with the ultimate goal of developing therapies to\n', '   break the link between them.\n', '\n', '   Obesity can bring with it a myriad of serious and even potentially\n', '   fatal health problems, including cardiovascular disease, type 2\n', '   diabetes and cancer. But these conditions and the timing of their onset\n', '   are not universal; they develop much later for some patients than\n', '   others, and a select few escape almost entirely. A number of reasons --\n', '   genetics, diet, physical activity and the type of fat -- contribute to\n', "   this variability. Dr. Cohen's work focuses on understanding the\n", '   molecular underpinnings of obesity related diseases.\n', '\n', '   Epidemiological studies have shown visceral adipose tissue, stored\n', '   around the abdomen, increases the risk for illness and death.\n', '   Meanwhile, subcutaneous adipose deposits, stored around the hips and\n', '   buttocks, do not raise these risks and may even provide some\n', '   protection. Evidence suggests the type of adipocytes within these two\n', '   varieties of tissue is responsible for the dichotomy.\n', '\n', '   In visceral fat, white adipocytes warehouse triglycerides in large\n', '   droplets. In obesity, this tissue is marked by inflammation and an\n', '   increased immune cell presence. However, other types of adipocytes\n', '   appear to have neutral or even beneficial effects. Brown fat, once only\n', '   known to occur in human infants and rodents, has recently been\n', '   discovered in small amounts in adults. Brown adipocytes can protect\n', '   body temperature by converting the chemical energy in the triglycerides\n', '   they store into heat, and may also make significant contributions to\n', '   adult metabolism. Likewise, a third type, beige adipocytes, can become\n', '   activated when exposed to cold or certain hormones and can dissipate\n', '   energy just like brown adipocytes. In rodents, beige adipocytes occur\n', '   in clusters surrounded by white adipocytes in subcutaneous fat,\n', '   suggesting the reason for the neutral to beneficial effects of that\n', '   tissue. Beige adipocytes are present in humans as well, though their\n', '   location and physiological role have yet to be fully defined.\n', '\n', '   Using animal and cellular models and translational approaches in\n', '   humans, Dr. Cohen investigates the transcriptional basis for the\n', '   harmful and health protecting effects of fat deposits and the\n', '   adipocytes they contain. Ultimately, he hopes to develop ways to\n', '   engineer healthier fat by manipulating the regulation of the beneficial\n', '   and adverse traits associated with different types of adipocytes.\n', '\n', '   As a postdoc, Dr. Cohen identified a promising target for this\n', '   approach, PRDM16, which binds in a complex with other proteins to\n', '   regulate gene expression. Dr. Cohen and colleagues found PRDM16 acts as\n', '   a molecular switch that determines some of the key functional\n', '   differences between visceral and subcutaneous fat. It does so by\n', '   activating beige adipocytes, prompting them to burn calories rather\n', '   than store them. When they knocked out the PRDM16 gene in adipose\n', '   tissue in mice, their beige adipocytes no longer functioned properly,\n', '   and the animals developed obesity, insulin resistance and fatty liver.\n', '   Meanwhile, their subcutaneous fat came to resemble visceral fat, both\n', '   on molecular and morphological levels.\n', '\n', '   Dr. Cohen is now investigating whether a lack of PRDM16 produces the\n', '   negative health effects associated with visceral fat, or if the\n', '   presence of some other regulatory factor is required. His current work\n', '   also includes investigating the origins of specific obesity-related\n', '   conditions: With mouse models developed as part of his work on\n', '   transcriptional control, Dr. Cohen is studying the interactions between\n', '   adipocytes and conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease\n', '   and cancer.\n', '\n', '   CAREER\n', '\n', "   Dr. Cohen earned his bachelor's degree in biology at Harvard\n", '   University, graduating magna cum laude.

This process involves activation of highly\n', '   complex signal transduction cascades. For the last 10 years, the group\n', '   has applied this knowledge to the study of the molecular pathways\n', '   behind various neurological and psychiatric disorders.\n', '\n', '   One major area of activity in the Greengard laboratory involves a\n', '   search for the molecular and cellular basis of major depressive\n', '   disorder. They recently found a protein called p11 (S100A10, a member\n', '   of the S100 family of proteins) that plays a central role in the\n', '   regulation of mood. Constitutive removal of p11 from neurons in the\n', '   brain causes a depressive phenotype and a loss of behavioral response\n', '   to antidepressant agents. Deletion of p11 from one cell type in the\n', '   nucleus accumbens causes the depressive phenotype, and deletion from\n', '   any of three other cell types results in the loss of behavioral\n', '   responses to antidepressants. The antidepressant action of p11 is\n', '   mediated through binding of p11 to a chromatin-remodeling factor,\n', '   SMARCA3. SMARCA3, in turn, through activation of various transcription\n', '   factors, regulates gene transcription. One current project of the\n', '   research group is to determine which of these genes is necessary for\n', '   the therapeutic actions of various antidepressants and to determine the\n', '   molecular mechanisms of action of these gene products.\n', '\n', '   A second major area of interest of the laboratory is the analysis of\n', '   the enzymatic pathways involved in the synthesis and degradation of\n', "   amyloid-b, the prime suspect in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease.\n", '   The enzyme g-secretase catalyzes the formation of amyloid-b, the\n', '   substance believed to be responsible for the death of nerve cells in\n', "   Alzheimer's disease. In addition, g-secretase catalyzes the formation\n", '   of notch and of many other proteins vital to cell function. The group\n', '   has recently discovered a protein, which they named g-secretase\n', '   activating protein (GSAP), that selectively activates the catalytic\n', '   formation of amyloid-b by g-secretase, but not of notch. As a result,\n', '   inhibitors of GSAP selectively prevent formation of amyloid-b without\n', '   affecting formation of notch and other vital products. Therefore, GSAP\n', '   represents a singularly attractive target for the development of drugs\n', "   to inhibit amyloid-b formation and thus prevent Alzheimer's disease,\n", '   without toxic side effects. In other studies in the laboratory, two\n', '   pathways involved in regulation of amyloid-b degradation have been\n', '   found, and the mechanisms by which these pathways achieve their effects\n', '   are being investigated.\n', '\n', '   A third area of activity of the laboratory involves determining the\n', '   molecular basis for the differences between vulnerable cells and\n', "   non-vulnerable cells in Alzheimer's disease and in Parkinson's disease.\n", '   This approach is based on identifying all expressed proteins in\n', '   individual nerve cell types in the brain using bacTRAP technology,\n', "   which was developed in collaboration with Rockefeller's Nathaniel\n", '   Heintz. Proteins that are highly expressed in vulnerable cells are\n', '   introduced to non-vulnerable cells to see if they cause vulnerability.\n', '   Conversely, proteins that are highly expressed in non-vulnerable cells\n', '   are introduced to vulnerable cells to see if they afford protection.\n', '\n', 'CAREER\n', '\n', '   Dr. Greengard received his Ph.D. in biophysics from The Johns Hopkins\n', '   University in 1953.

Because the ionic\n', '   movements are passive, ion channels would seem to be extraordinarily\n', '   simple physical systems, yet they are responsible for electrical\n', '   signaling in living cells. Among their many functions, ion channels\n', '   control the pace of the heart, regulate the secretion of hormones into\n', '   the bloodstream, and generate the electrical impulses underlying\n', "   information transfer in the nervous system. Dr. MacKinnon's research is\n", '   aimed at understanding the physical and chemical principles underlying\n', '   ion channel function.\n', '   Ion Conduction and\n', '   Selectivity\n', '   Ion channels, like enzymes, have their specific substrates: potassium,\n', '   sodium, calcium and chloride channels permit only their namesake ions\n', '   to diffuse through their pores. Ion selectivity refers to the ability\n', '   of channels to discriminate among ions. Without ion selectivity,\n', '   electrical signal production in biology as we know it would be\n', '   impossible. The MacKinnon laboratory used mutational analysis to show\n', '   that potassium channels are tetramers of identical subunits and that\n', '   specific "signature sequence" amino acids are responsible for potassium\n', '   selectivity. The signature sequence is conserved in all potassium\n', '   channels throughout nature and forms a structural unit called the\n', '   selectivity filter.\n', '   To understand how the selectivity filter conducts potassium ions\n', '   rapidly and selectively, the MacKinnon lab determined the x-ray\n', '   structures of numerous potassium channels, including the KcsA potassium\n', '   channel at a resolution higher than 2.0 \xc5. The selectivity filter is a\n', '   narrow, 12-\xc5-long segment of the pore that is lined with carbonyl\n', '   oxygen atoms. These atoms act as surrogate water molecules, allowing\n', '   potassium ions to shed their hydration shell and enter into the pore.\n', '   The lab showed that two potassium ions bind in the selectivity filter\n', '   at once, most likely with a single intervening water molecule. The data\n', '   support a mechanism in which entry of a third potassium ion on one side\n', '   of the filter is associated with concerted potassium ion exit from the\n', '   opposite side, giving rise to efficient potassium ion conduction.\n', '   Electrostatic repulsion between ions inside the filter prevents the\n', '   potassium ions from binding too tightly, thus allowing them to conduct\n', '   at a high rate.\n', '   Dr. MacKinnon has developed methods for chemical synthesis and folding\n', '   of a functional potassium channel in collaboration with Tom Muir, at\n', '   Princeton University. Using these methods, they synthesized potassium\n', '   channels with main-chain and side-chain chemical groups that do not\n', '   occur in natural proteins. The chemical synthesis of "unnatural"\n', '   potassium channels has shown that a specific conformation of the\n', '   selectivity filter is important for preventing sodium conduction when\n', '   potassium ions are not present in solution. When potassium ions are\n', '   present, they prevent sodium conduction through competition for binding\n', '   sites.\n', '   Chloride channels and transporters mediate the conduction of chloride\n', '   ions across cell membranes. To understand the chemistry of anion\n', '   selectivity, Dr. MacKinnon and his colleagues determined the atomic\n', '   structures of two prokaryotic and one eukaryotic member of the CLC\n', '   chloride channel family. These anion-selective transport proteins are\n', '   built on a completely different architectural plan than that of\n', '   potassium channels, but they nevertheless use many of the same basic\n', '   physical principles to catalyze selective ionic movement across the\n', '   membrane. These principles of selective ion movement include oriented\n', '   alpha-helical-end charges to stabilize ions inside the membrane and\n', '   short selectivity filters containing multiple ions in a queue to\n', '   mediate conduction. These structures have also led to an atomic model\n', '   that explains how CLC transporters couple the counter transport of two\n', '   chloride ions per single proton across the cell membrane.\n', '   Ion Channel Gating\n', '   In humans, 78 unique potassium channel genes underlie an impressive\n', '   level of functional diversity. The different potassium channels have\n', '   evolved the ability to open -- by a process called gating -- in\n', '   response to different forces in their environment. Certain potassium\n', '   channels are gated by the binding of calcium ions, specific membrane\n', '   lipids, or G protein subunits. Others respond to mechanical\n', '   perturbations of the membrane or changes in voltage across the\n', "   membrane. Thus, the potassium channels control a cell's electrical\n", '   state through many different avenues.\n', '   To understand the atomic basis of potassium channel gating, the\n', '   MacKinnon lab has analyzed the function and determined the structures\n', '   of several different members of the potassium channel family. MthK is a\n', '   prokaryotic calcium-gated potassium channel, and the BK channel is a\n', '   eukaryotic cousin of MthK that regulates vascular and airway smooth\n', '   muscle tone in mammals. Through studies of these channels they have\n', '   begun to understand how the free energy of calcium binding is converted\n', '   to mechanical work to open the pore.\n', '   Inward rectifier potassium (Kir) channels control the resting membrane\n', '   voltage in many neuronal and muscle cells. The lab has recently\n', '   determined atomic structures to understand how the signaling lipid PIP2\n', '   regulates gating in Kir2 (a lipid gated channel) and how G proteins\n', '   regulate gating in Kir3 (a G protein gated channel). In Kir2, when PIP2\n', '   binds to the channel it causes a large cytoplasmic domain to move 6 \xc5\n', '   to a position that opens the pore. In essence, PIP2 serves as molecular\n', '   Velcro to tether two components of the channel together, a requirement\n', '   to open the conduction pathway. In Kir3, large G protein subunits (b\n', '   and g subunits) bind to the channel at the intracellular interface\n', "   where the channel meets the cell's interior. When the G protein\n", '   subunits bind they cause a twisting of the a helices that form the\n', "   pore's gate, and begin to open it. The structure of Kir3 with the G\n", '   protein subunits bound complete a story that began in 1921, when Otto\n', '   Loewi discovered that vagus nerve stimulation slows the heart rate. In\n', "   Dr. Loewi's experiments, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine was\n", '   released from the nerve and activated a G protein coupled receptor in\n', '   the heart pacemaker cells. The G proteins bound to Kir3 and opened it,\n', '   by a mechanism revealed now in atomic detail, to hyperpolarize the\n', '   pacemaker cell membrane and slow the heart rate.\n', '   Probably the most difficult and in many ways fascinating form of gating\n', '   the group has studied is called voltage-dependent gating. This gating\n', '   allows "excitable" cells to produce electrical impulses called action\n', '   potentials: these underlie muscle contraction and nervous system\n', "   function. Dr. MacKinnon's group has determined structures of both\n", '   archaebacterial and eukaryotic voltage-dependent potassium (Kv)\n', '   channels. In 2005, they published the structure of the Kv1.2 channel\n', '   from rat, which was the first recombinant eukaryotic membrane protein\n', '   structure ever solved by x-ray crystallography. Since, they have solved\n', '   numerous structures to deduce mechanism. Based on these findings they\n', '   have posited several fundamentally new ideas: (1) voltage-sensor\n', '   domains are loosely attached to the pore at its perimeter, (2) they\n', '   contain a helix-turn-helix element that they named the voltage-sensor\n', '   paddle, (3) the voltage-sensor moves in intimate contact with the\n', '   membrane, carrying with it charges within the membrane electric field,\n', '   and (4) the voltage sensor is attached to levers that mechanically open\n', '   and close the pore. These structures are allowing researchers to begin\n', '   to understand how nature, through its ion channel voltage sensors, has\n', "   evolved the analog of a `field effect transistor' to produce action\n", '   potentials, which have permitted rapid information transfer in living\n', '   systems. It is fascinating to realize that voltage-dependent gating,\n', '   which at a cellular level would seem to be the most complex form of\n', '   gating, at a molecular level might be the simplest: the voltage across\n', '   the membrane sets up an electric field that pulls and pushes a charged\n', '   voltage sensor that is attached to a lever that opens and closes the\n', '   pore.\n', "   Most recently Dr. MacKinnon's group has begun to study a different form\n", '   of gating called mechanical gating. They would like to understand how\n', '   mechanical forces elicit electrical signals. This form of gating\n', '   underlies sensory detection as in touch and hearing. It also underlies\n', '   basic physiological processes such as cell volume regulation and blood\n', '   pressure control. Dr. MacKinnon and others have observed significant\n', '   mechanosensitivity in the gating of certain potassium and calcium\n', '   channels. Now they seek to understand whether mechanosensitivity is\n', '   physiologically relevant in potassium and calcium channels. They have\n', '   also determined atomic structures of the human TRAAK channel, which is\n', '   strongly mechanosensitive, to understand how it transduces mechanical\n', '   forces, and why the central nervous system expresses a mechanosensitive\n', '   potassium channel.\n', '   The family of potassium channels provides an incredible example of\n', '   molecular diversity. In an attempt to understand these molecules one\n', "   never ceases to be amazed by life's simple solutions to what at first\n", '   appear to be complicated tasks.\n', '\n', 'CAREER\n', '\n', '   Dr. MacKinnon received his B.A. in biochemistry from Brandeis\n', '   University and his M.D. from Tufts University School of Medicine.

Using primarily biophysical tools with a heavy\n', '   emphasis on imaging, lab members examine the movement of single\n', '   proteins in the cell, single proteins and toxins as they cross\n', '   membranes, assembly of single viruses, transport of single vesicles,\n', '   single mitochondria and single cells during apoptosis, and metastasis\n', '   of single tumor cells through the body.\n', '\n', '   Why imaging? Dr. Simon uses imaging techniques to observe and clarify\n', '   dynamics and interactions in living systems. Imaging enables his group\n', '   to study molecules in isolation, in the living cell or in the living\n', '   animal and, often, to detect alternations of single molecules that\n', '   produce pathological changes in the whole animal by allowing studies in\n', '   both spatial scales. Imaging single molecules or cells provides the\n', '   means to report not only the average behavior of populations, but also\n', '   the diversity of their individual behaviors.\n', '\n', '   Why study individuals? Dr. Simon also focuses on individual entities\n', '   and events. The study of populations (whether populations of molecules,\n', '   cells or people) has provided important insights into many biological\n', '   processes. However, sometimes valuable information is lost when one\n', '   examines the average of a population -- information that is retained\n', '   when one studies individuals. For example, if a cellular machine exists\n', '   in two discrete states, the macroscopic measure will give the average\n', '   of the two states. But such a measure has several shortcomings,\n', '   according to Dr. Simon. First, the averaged (macroscopic) measure may\n', '   reflect an activity state that does not exist at the level of the\n', '   individual. Second, often in biology the active state is transient.\n', '   Macroscopic measurements report the average and therefore miss out on\n', '   these transients; short-lived but functionally significant states can\n', '   be detected and studied by examining individuals. Third, macroscopic\n', '   measurements can make it difficult to put the different steps in a\n', '   proper temporal order. On a macroscopic level this can be addressed by\n', '   synchronizing a system. However, as it progresses through subsequent\n', '   steps, the relative temporal ordering is lost. At the single-molecule\n', '   level the temporal order is unambiguous. Fourth, at a macroscopic level\n', '   it is often impossible to resolve between two microscopic mechanisms\n', '   that can be resolved by studying single molecules.\n', '\n', '   The ability to follow single events has allowed Dr. Simon and his lab\n', '   members to follow individual vesicles as they dock and fuse to the\n', '   membrane, individual endosomes as they form, single proteins as they\n', '   translocate across the endoplasmic reticulum and single cells as they\n', '   metastasize in the lung. They have also succeeded in imaging the birth\n', '   of individual HIV particles and a variety of events involved with\n', '   apoptosis. The sensitivity afforded by these imaging studies has\n', '   allowed them to critically test, and in some cases eliminate, models\n', '   that had been proposed for biological mechanisms. The ability to test\n', '   -- and at times negate -- models has driven lab members to formulate\n', '   new models: They were the first to propose localized calcium transients\n', '   in cells and the first to suggest that protein movement in the cell may\n', '   be driven by a Brownian ratchet.\n', '\n', '   A key area of research in the Simon lab is in developing new\n', '   technologies that can improve the spatial or temporal resolution of\n', '   images obtained through microscopes and other modalities. Dr. Simon and\n', '   his colleagues are working to improve the sensitivity of the imaging\n', '   systems they use so that molecules can be followed for longer periods\n', '   of time, and to develop new reporters that can follow biological\n', '   processes and act as actuators for these processes.\n', '\n', 'CAREER\n', '\n', "   Dr. Simon graduated with a bachelor's degree in neurobiology from\n", '   Princeton University in 1977.

These studies\n', '   indicate that essentially all bacteria -- from those with fully\n', '   sequenced genomes to those not yet cultured -- are rich sources of\n', '   unstudied natural product biosynthetic gene clusters. Using methods\n', '   from molecular biology, organic chemistry and microbiology, Dr. Brady\n', '   is working to gain access to these previously inaccessible natural\n', '   products and their biosynthetic gene clusters. The development of\n', '   methods to functionally access the wealth of previously inaccessible\n', '   natural product biosynthetic pathways known to be present in bacterial\n', '   genomes should significantly increase the number and diversity of\n', '   natural products available to test as probes of biological processes\n', '   and therapeutic agents.\n', '\n', '   Soil microbes that have not yet been cultured outnumber their cultured\n', '   counterparts by at least two to three orders of magnitude. Uncultured\n', '   bacteria are one of the largest pools of genetic diversity that remain\n', '   unexamined for the production of potentially useful natural products.\n', "   Dr. Brady's first research focus is the development of new strategies\n", '   for studying genetically encoded small molecules produced by uncultured\n', '   bacteria. Although most bacteria are not readily grown in the\n', '   laboratory, making it difficult to use traditional microbiological\n', '   methods to characterize the natural products they create, microbial DNA\n', '   can be extracted directly from environmental samples and cloned in\n', '   easily cultured bacteria. Dr. Brady has worked extensively on the\n', '   development of genetic strategies to access the vast chemical and\n', '   biosynthetic potential of uncultured, previously inaccessible,\n', '   bacteria. This has allowed for the construction of large libraries of\n', '   environmental DNA, as well as the development of methods to screen\n', '   these libraries. Such culture-independent methods are leading Dr. Brady\n', '   to identify new natural products, biosynthetic enzymes and bacterial\n', "   signaling systems. Dr. Brady's work has shown that large environmental\n", '   DNA libraries are a promising source of both new derivatives of\n', '   pharmacologically important classes of natural products as well as\n', '   completely novel families of bioactive natural products. His group has\n', '   begun mapping the presence of promising microbial gene clusters found\n', '   in soil samples collected around the world. These maps may help guide\n', '   the discovery of natural products by directing investigators to certain\n', '   regions and environments.\n', '\n', '   The second focus of the Brady lab, the chemistry of human\n', '   microbiome-associated and pathogenic bacteria, could one day help\n', '   address the problem of drug-resistant bacteria. Pathogenic bacteria\n', '   have evolved elaborate signaling systems and toxins vital to their\n', '   ability to initiate and maintain infections. The annotation of\n', '   completely sequenced bacterial genomes has led to the identification of\n', '   natural product biosynthetic gene clusters whose predicted products do\n', '   not correspond to any molecules previously characterized from these\n', '   organisms. Dr. Brady uses bioinformatics to examine the genomes of\n', '   sequenced bacteria, looking to identify gene clusters that could code\n', '   for novel signaling molecules and toxins. By studying the complex\n', '   collections of small molecules used by bacterial pathogens, he hopes to\n', '   gain new insight into the molecules used during infection and, in turn,\n', '   determine how to best disrupt key steps in the establishment and\n', '   propagation of bacterial infections.\n', '\n', 'CAREER\n', '\n', '   Dr. Brady graduated with a degree in molecular biology in 1993 from\n', '   Pomona College.

Ribosome maturation, the process by\n', '   which ribosomes are synthesized, is a very complex process, which\n', '   involves approximately 200 factors in eukaryotes, of which most are\n', '   essential for viability. These factors are involved in all stages of\n', '   ribosome maturation, from transcription of ribosomal RNA in the\n', '   nucleolus to export into the cytoplasm, where final stages of\n', '   maturation occur. Our knowledge of the molecular machinery responsible\n', '   for ribosome maturation is currently limited by a lack of structural\n', '   information. Although work on the prokaryotic ribosome has advanced\n', '   with structural studies of several important functional complexes,\n', '   there had until recently been no atomic-level structural information\n', '   about corresponding eukaryotic subunits.

The structure\n', '   illustrates the complex functional architecture of the eukaryotic 60S\n', '   subunit, which comprises an intricate network of interactions between\n', '   eukaryote-specific ribosomal protein features and RNA expansion\n', '   segments.

In contrast to the prokaryotic 50S subunit, in\n', '   which ribosomal proteins are isolated entities, the 60S ribosomal\n', '   proteins are largely interconnected, giving rise to an intricate\n', '   network of interactions. Eukaryote-specific proteins frequently fulfill\n', '   key structural roles by interacting with RNA expansion segments.

The Shaham lab uses\n', '   the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in its studies and has demonstrated\n', '   that underlying both areas of research are cellular programs conserved\n', '   from C. elegans to humans.\n', '\n', '   Nervous systems consist of two major cell types: neurons and glia.\n', '   Basic properties of neurons and mechanisms governing neuronal\n', '   development and function are well studied. However, the functions of\n', '   glia, the most abundant cell type in vertebrate nervous systems, remain\n', '   mostly unexplored, and few mediators of glial function are known. Glia\n', '   are important in disease: 95 percent of brain malignancies are of glial\n', '   character, and glial defects are associated with neurodegenerative\n', "   diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's\n", '   disease, suggesting that understanding glial functions, and how they go\n', '   awry, is indispensable for comprehending brain functions and\n', '   dysfunctions.\n', '\n', '   One explanation for the gap in understanding glia may lie in their\n', '   neurotrophic properties. Glial manipulation often results in neuronal\n', '   loss, precluding investigations of other effects glia may have on\n', '   neuronal morphogenesis or activity. The Shaham lab has discovered that\n', '   glia of the nematode C. elegans bear striking morphological, anatomical\n', '   and molecular similarities to vertebrate glia. Importantly, C. elegans\n', '   glia are not required for neuronal survival, making C. elegans a unique\n', '   model for deciphering glial roles in the nervous system and allowing,\n', '   for the first time, manipulation of these cells in vivo without the\n', '   complication of neuronal loss.\n', '\n', '   The Shaham lab has shown that glia are essential for neural\n', '   development, promoting axon outgrowth and dendrite extension, and that\n', '   glia are required for morphological plasticity of neuronal receptive\n', '   endings; indeed, some sensory receptive structures fail to form in\n', '   their absence. The lab has also uncovered morphology-independent roles\n', '   for glia in sensory neuron function, showing that animals lacking glia\n', '   exhibit profound sensory deficits. To understand the bases of these\n', '   functional interactions, the Shaham lab has identified glia-enriched\n', '   proteins and studied their roles in neuronal development and function.\n', '\n', '   Although C. elegans glia do not control neuronal survival, the Shaham\n', '   lab has explored the death of other C. elegans cells to understand the\n', '   principles by which vertebrate glia might control neuronal viability.\n', '   In addition to discovering novel transcriptional and protein\n', '   degradation-mediated controls of apoptotic cell death, the lab has\n', '   identified a novel cell death program independent of known apoptotic\n', '   regulators. The unique morphology accompanying this cell death program\n', '   is conserved during development of the vertebrate nervous system. The\n', '   Shaham lab identified many genes promoting this new cell death form,\n', '   all of which are conserved in vertebrates, raising the possibility that\n', '   the mechanism of this novel cell death program is also conserved.\n', '\n', 'CAREER\n', '\n', '   Dr. Shaham received his A.B. degree in biochemistry from Columbia\n', '   University in 1989.

Dr. Tavazoie's laboratory employs a systems biological\n", '   approach that integrates molecular, cellular, animal and clinical\n', '   observations to identify and characterize key molecular regulators of\n', '   this complex process, with the ultimate goal of developing novel\n', '   therapies aimed at its prevention and treatment.\n', '\n', '   This year, over eight million people will die from cancer globally. For\n', '   a large fraction of these individuals, the cause of death will be\n', '   metastatic colonization of distant organs by cancer cells. While the\n', '   impact of this process on human mortality has long been recognized, the\n', '   molecular mechanisms that underlie cancer metastasis have only recently\n', '   begun to be intensely studied. As is the case with developmental\n', '   programs, metastatic progression by cancer cells requires the proper\n', '   expression of effector genes that drive specific cellular and\n', '   cell-biological phenotypes. Dr. Tavazoie is a cancer biologist and\n', '   medical oncologist who is fundamentally interested in how such\n', '   prometastatic gene expression programs are established in cancer cells,\n', '   how they enable cancer cells to metastasize and how such programs\n', '   emerge during cancer progression.\n', '\n', "   Dr. Tavazoie's laboratory employs a combination of molecular, genomic,\n", '   biochemical, genetic, imaging and computational approaches to study\n', '   this process. These insights, combined with in vitro, in vivo, genetic\n', '   and clinical association observations, are used to generate an\n', '   integrated molecular and biological model of metastatic progression.\n', '   This systematic approach has revealed that the acquisition of the\n', '   metastatic phenotype by breast cancer cells requires the silencing of\n', '   specific small noncoding RNAs (microRNAs). The silencing of these small\n', '   RNAs leads to the enhanced expression of their target genes, which the\n', "   lab identified to be promoters of metastatic phenotypes. Dr. Tavazoie's\n", '   lab has generalized their findings to other prevalent cancers arising\n', '   from distinct developmental lineages such as melanoma and colorectal\n', '   cancer and have found that in these cancers, modulated expression of\n', '   tissue-specific sets of small RNAs achieve enhanced metastatic\n', '   outcomes. By experimentally modulating these metastasis regulatory\n', '   microRNAs, the metastatic activity of cancer cells can be strongly\n', '   impacted. Importantly, the expression levels of these specific\n', '   microRNAs and their target genes in human cancer specimens support\n', '   their functionally implicated roles in cancer.\n', '\n', '   The use of these microRNAs as molecular probes has enabled Dr. Tavazoie\n', '   to very efficiently uncover the cellular phenotypes they control and to\n', '   implicate their downstream target genes and pathways as novel effectors\n', '   of metastatic progression. His lab has established mouse metastasis\n', '   systems that model the progression of prevalent human cancers, such as\n', '   triple negative breast cancer, melanoma and colorectal cancer. These\n', '   cancers were chosen because as a whole, they impact an exceedingly\n', '   large number of patients globally; effective targeted therapies that\n', '   prevent metastatic progression by these malignancies do not exist; and\n', '   their derivation from three distinct developmental lineages makes it\n', '   possible to determine how cells from diverse tissue origins achieve\n', '   common phenotypic outcomes.

The insights\n', '   gained from these studies could reveal previously uncharacterized\n', '   mechanisms of gene expression regulation that might operate in normal\n', '   cells and could reveal new avenues for therapeutic intervention in\n', '   patients at risk for metastatic relapse.\n', '\n', 'CAREER\n', '\n', '   Dr. Tavazoie received his undergraduate degree from the University of\n', '   California, Berkeley, his Ph.D. from Harvard University and his M.D.\n', '   from Harvard Medical School and the Harvard-MIT Division of Health\n', '   Sciences and Technology.

Dr. Kapoor's laboratory\n", '   works at the interface of chemistry and biology to investigate the\n', '   molecular and physical mechanisms that explain how exactly one copy of\n', '   the genome is delivered to each daughter cell during cell division.\n', '\n', '   Human cells divide approximately 10,000 trillion times during a\n', '   lifetime. During cell division, cells must suspend DNA repair, protein\n', '   synthesis and other essential activities. As a result, cells need to\n', '   complete cell division quickly and precisely; in human cells, this\n', '   process requires only an hour. If the metaphase spindle does not\n', "   properly separate the parent cell's DNA to the two daughter cells,\n", '   diseases, such as cancer, and developmental defects, such as Down\n', '   syndrome, may result. Dr. Kapoor is interested in understanding the\n', '   fundamental mechanisms that allow cells to achieve this delicate\n', '   balance between speed and accuracy.\n', '\n', '   The complex, sequential and rapid nature of this process makes it\n', '   difficult to study, and, because of the limitations of conventional\n', '   approaches, several basic questions about the operation and function of\n', '   the mitotic spindle remain unanswered. Typically, researchers must\n', '   choose either whole-system studies that do not offer precise insight\n', '   into biochemical details, or studies of proteins in isolation and out\n', '   of their physiological context. Dr. Kapoor develops chemistry-based\n', '   approaches to close this gap.\n', '\n', '   His lab has discovered and synthesized small organic molecules that can\n', '   enter cells and interfere with cell division processes within minutes\n', '   or seconds.

For\n', '   instance, Dr. Kapoor and colleagues identified small molecules known as\n', '   ciliobrevins. They used these to block the activity of the motor\n', '   protein cytoplasmic dynein, which is involved in many cellular\n', "   processes.

These structures are the\n', '   product of nanometer-sized proteins decoding micron-sized geometric\n', '   attributes, such as microtubule length and orientation. In recent work,\n', "   Dr. Kapoor's lab has shown how two proteins, PRC1 and kinesin-4, mark\n", '   the plus ends of microtubules with tags proportional to the length of\n', '   the microtubules but one thousand times bigger than PRC1 and kinesin-4.\n', '   These tags may help the cell select and organize microtubules to\n', '   position the cell division plane and keep chromosomes segregated during\n', '   the final stages of division.\n', '\n', '   The quest to better understand cell division has immediate implications\n', '   for medicine because it can lead to the development of therapies for\n', '   diseases associated with improper division.

These siRNAs are\n', '   processed from longer double-stranded RNA precursors and assemble into\n', '   effector complexes that destabilize messenger RNAs partially or fully\n', '   complementary to one of the siRNA strands. Eukaryotic cells express a\n', '   variety of classes of small RNAs to control gene expression. The Tuschl\n', '   lab identified these classes and their many members using specialized\n', '   cloning techniques.

Deficiency in telomere function can cause\n', '   genomic alterations in cancer, and the gradual loss of telomeres\n', '   contributes to aging of human cells.\n', '\n', "   Dr. de Lange's lab focuses on mammalian telomeres, which are made up of\n", '   long arrays of double-stranded TTAGGG repeats that end in a\n', "   single-stranded 3' overhang. These telomeric repeats wither away in a\n", '   shortening process that is associated with cell proliferation.\n', '   Telomerase can counteract this attrition and stabilizes telomeres by\n', '   adding back telomeric repeats. However, telomerase is absent from most\n', '   human somatic cells, and, as a result, cells eventually die due to\n', '   depletion of their telomere reserve. Cancer cells, on the other hand,\n', '   usually reactivate telomerase, thereby achieving unlimited\n', "   proliferative potential. The goal of Dr. de Lange's research is to\n", '   understand how telomeres protect chromosome ends, and what happens when\n', '   telomere function is lost during the early stages of tumorigenesis\n', '   before telomerase is activated.\n', '\n', '   The de Lange lab identified a six-subunit protein complex, which they\n', '   named shelterin, that specifically binds to telomeres.\n', '   Using Cre-mediated conditional deletion in mouse embryo fibroblasts,\n', '   Dr. de Lange and her colleagues determined the fate of telomeres\n', '   lacking one or more of the six shelterin subunits.

In addition, shelterin represses three DNA\n', '   double-strand break repair pathways at telomeres, two types of\n', '   nonhomologous end joining and homology-directed repair, which have\n', '   detrimental outcomes at telomeres. Finally, shelterin protects\n', '   telomeres against a sixth threat: the inappropriate resection of the\n', '   telomeric DNA by nucleases.\n', '\n', "   Dr. de Lange's group is now working to determine the mechanism by which\n", '   each shelterin protein inhibits its designated pathway, and how loss of\n', '   telomere protection contributes to genome instability in human cancer.\n', '   A major mechanistic insight arose from the identification of the t-loop\n', '   structure of telomeres in which the single-stranded overhang is\n', '   inserted in the double-stranded repeat array of the telomere, thereby\n', '   hiding the telomere end from the DNA damage response. Recent data\n', '   showed that the TRF2 component of shelterin is required to establish\n', '   and/or maintain this structure. Since TRF2 is responsible for the\n', '   repression of the ATM kinase pathway and non-homologous end joining, it\n', '   is likely that the t-loop structure is critical to prevent these two\n', '   pathways from acting inappropriately on chromosome ends.\n', '\n', 'CAREER\n', '\n', '   Dr. de Lange earned her Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of\n', '   Amsterdam and the Netherlands Cancer Institute in 1985.

The Fischetti lab is working to understand the\n', '   earliest events that occur when gram-positive bacteria interact with\n', '   human tissues and cause disease. His research is aimed at developing\n', '   strategies to interfere with these events, such as vaccines to induce a\n', '   mucosal immune response, and using phage lytic enzymes to both remove\n', '   colonizing pathogenic bacteria to prevent infection and treat\n', '   established infections.\n', '\n', '   Dr. Fischetti works with gram-positive bacteria, such as streptococci\n', '   and staphylococci, organisms that do not contain a second cell membrane\n', '   outside of the cell wall. In the fight against infectious disease, Dr.\n', '   Fischetti develops unique treatment strategies to prevent infection.\n', '   His approach involves novel anti-infectives and exploring the use of\n', '   phage lytic enzymes to remove pathogenic bacteria from infected\n', '   tissues.\n', '\n', "   Dr. Fischetti's lab uses recombinantly produced phage lysins that will\n", '   kill the major gram-positive pathogens -- Streptococcus pyogenes,\n', '   Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis\n', '   and Bacillus anthracis -- and has used these enzymes to destroy their\n', '   respective bacteria in animal models of disease. The enzymes are\n', '   extremely potent; microgram quantities are needed to destroy millions\n', '   of organisms within seconds of contact. They are also highly specific\n', '   and unlike antibiotics, only kill the disease-causing bacteria without\n', "   harming the beneficial bacteria. Dr. Fischetti's studies have shown\n", '   that when small amounts of the phage lysins are administered to mice\n', '   that have intentionally been infected with these bacteria, the\n', '   disease-causing bacteria are rapidly destroyed. In an animal model of\n', '   pneumococcus pneumonia, Dr. Fischetti and his collaborators have shown\n', '   that systemic administration of the phage enzyme Cpl-1 can rescue mice\n', '   infected with the pathogen and completely reverse lung tissue damage if\n', '   given within 24 hours postinfection. Dr. Fischetti and his colleagues\n', '   showed that when the enzyme is delivered to the brains of mice with\n', '   pneumococcal meningitis, it effectively removes the organisms from the\n', '   site. The lab has also shown that by removing colonizing S. pneumoniae\n', '   from the nose of mice, they could completely prevent secondary ear\n', '   infections triggered by influenza. This lysin technology has been\n', '   licensed and is expected to proceed to human trials.\n', '\n', "   Using lytic enzymes as a tool, Dr. Fischetti's lab developed a method\n", '   of drilling through the thick cell walls of gram-positive bacteria\n', '   while keeping them intact. The technique enabled the Fischetti lab to\n', '   access the bacterial cytoplasm with labeled antibodies to study\n', '   intracellular molecules that were previously inaccessible.\n', '\n', '   As new antibiotics are proving futile against resistant strains of\n', '   bacteria, the Fischetti lab has developed a method to identify novel\n', '   targets in bacterial cells that have proven to produce\n', '   "resistance-proof" antibiotics. The approach exploits the billion-year\n', '   association of bacteriophage and bacteria, in which bacteriophages have\n', '   identified weak points in bacteria that can be exploited for antibiotic\n', '   development. Using this approach, the Fischetti lab has identified a\n', '   novel target, the enzyme 2-epimerase, in the biosynthetic pathway for\n', '   cell wall biosynthesis that is critical for bacterial survival. A novel\n', '   inhibitor based on this target, Epimerox, was found to protect animals\n', '   from lethal infection, and when bacteria were tested for resistance to\n', '   Epimerox, none could be found (the frequency of resistance was less\n', '   than 10^-11).\n', '\n', '   To infect their host, bacteria use their surface molecules to attach\n', '   and invade human tissues, particularly those that line the nose and\n', '   throat. Knowledge of the process bacteria use to anchor these molecules\n', '   in their cell walls could lead to strategies to prevent infection. The\n', '   M protein is a surface protein that is the major virulence factor of\n', '   group A streptococci because of its ability to impede attack by human\n', "   white blood cells. Analysis of this molecule by Dr. Fischetti's lab\n", '   shows that the region used to attach the M protein to the streptococcal\n', '   cell surface is highly conserved in all gram-positive bacteria,\n', '   indicating that the mechanism for anchoring surface proteins in\n', '   bacteria is also conserved. Since bacteria cannot cause infection\n', '   without their surface proteins, a molecule that blocks surface protein\n', '   attachment will be broadly applicable to different gram-positive\n', '   bacteria.\n', '\n', 'CAREER\n', '\n', '   Dr. Fischetti grew up in New York City, receiving his B.S. in\n', '   bacteriology from Wagner College in 1962 and his M.S. in microbiology\n', '   from Long Island University in 1967.

Dr. Freiwald is interested in the neural processes that form\n', '   object representations as well as those that allow attention to make\n', '   those representations available for cognition.\n', '\n', '   The brain processes sensory information received by the eyes to form\n', '   our perceptual world of objects within a three-dimensional space.\n', '   Object representations combine information on attributes such as shape,\n', '   color and direction of motion. To understand the mechanisms that\n', "   control these processes, Dr. Freiwald's lab focuses on face recognition\n", '   and attention and uses a range of techniques, including functional\n', '   brain imaging and electrophysiology.\n', '\n', '   Faces are a special category of objects that are of high social and,\n', '   therefore, emotive and cognitive relevance. Using functional magnetic\n', '   resonance imaging (fMRI), Dr. Freiwald codiscovered a specialized\n', '   neural machinery for face processing located in the temporal and\n', '   frontal lobes of the brain. By combining fMRI with electrophysiological\n', '   techniques, he and his colleagues further showed that this machinery is\n', '   composed of a small network of a fixed number of face selective\n', '   regions, termed face patches, each dedicated to a different aspect of\n', '   face processing and all closely connected with each other. Because the\n', '   system is specialized to process one class of complex forms, and\n', '   because its computational components are spatially segregated, the face\n', '   patch system offers a unique opportunity to dissect the neural\n', '   mechanisms underlying form perception.\n', '\n', "   Dr. Freiwald's laboratory aims to understand the inner workings of this\n", '   system, from the level of individual cells to the interactions of brain\n', '   areas, in order to answer questions such as: How does face selectivity\n', '   emerge in a single cell? How is information transformed from one face\n', '   patch to another? What is the contribution of each face patch to\n', '   different face recognition abilities like the recognition of a friend\n', '   or a smile?

And how is information extracted from a patch when a perceptual\n', '   decision is made?\n', '\n', '   While the face processing system is used as a model system to\n', '   understand general object recognition mechanisms, the system also\n', '   allows fundamental computational questions to be addressed, including:\n', '   Why is visual information processing organized in hierarchies? How do\n', '   populations of neurons represent features? And how does activity\n', '   propagate through the cortex? By studying how the face processing\n', '   system is embedded in the brain, the Freiwald lab aims to connect it to\n', '   social behaviors and thereby contribute to understanding disturbances\n', '   of such behaviors in disease.\n', '\n', '   The Freiwald lab is also interested in how attentional control is\n', '   exerted, how it interacts dynamically with the environment, and how\n', '   attention interplays with sensory object representations. Vision is an\n', '   active process, and attention is the key active ingredient that selects\n', '   whatever is relevant for a behavioral goal and dismisses what is not.\n', '   Dr. Freiwald is using fMRI to determine the entire network of areas\n', '   involved in attention and identify its connections and functional\n', '   properties. Using a spatial attention and motion discrimination task,\n', '   the group has identified one network that includes a new cortical area\n', '   not previously suspected to be involved in attention.

Such molecular\n', '   "signatures" provide parts-lists that are available to the stem cells.\n', '   The challenge has been to functionally address the roles that these\n', '   molecules play in mediating the biological properties of HSC and ES\n', '   cells. Further, we would like to understand how these molecular\n', '   components are "wired" into regulatory signaling and transcriptional\n', '   networks.\n', '\n', '   \xc2 \xc2 \xc2 To explore these issues we have utilized a number of global\n', '   gene-expression perturbation technologies, such as inhibitory short\n', '   hairpin RNA (shRNA). We have successfully down regulated the expression\n', '   levels of candidate regulatory molecules in both HSC and ES cells. A\n', '   number of these play crucial regulatory roles in processes such as\n', '   self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation. We have further\n', '   developed strategies that allow the analyses of cell-fate change\n', '   dynamics at multiple biochemical and molecular levels in response to\n', '   defined and precisely controlled changes in the expression levels of\n', '   key regulatory molecules.

Our research focuses on two related aspects of the\n', '   biology that controls the integrity of the genome.\n', '\n', '\n', '   1. We study the control of the cell division cycle, and the signaling\n', '   pathways (checkpoints) that respond to chromosomal damage and prevent\n', '   cell cycle progression until that damage is repaired.\n', '\n', '\n', '   DNA damage checkpoints function throughout the cell cycle. Those\n', '   working in G1 phase to prevent the replication of damaged DNA are\n', '   almost invariably mutated or inactivated in cancers. These defects\n', '   contribute not only to the instability of tumor cell genomes, but can\n', '   also knock-out pro-apoptotic pathways, rendering tumors resistant to\n', '   treatment. Those functioning in G2 phase to prevent commitment to\n', '   mitosis are, however, virtually always intact and appear to be required\n', '   for the viability of tumor cells that lack G1 checkpoints. Our research\n', '   is geared to dissect the molecular and cell biology of G2 checkpoints,\n', '   and aims to use this knowledge in the design and testing of targeted\n', '   anti-cancer therapies. Taking genetic and genomic approaches, we\n', '   utilize fission yeast as a gene and pathway discovery tool, and then\n', '   apply this information to studies in human cells. We are currently\n', '   focusing our efforts into: (1) the regulation and function of a\n', '   checkpoint effector protein kinase, Chk1, informing its suitability as\n', '   a target in anti-cancer therapy; and (2) the initiating events that\n', '   modify lesions in DNA into structures that signal the checkpoint and\n', '   can be repaired.\n', '\n', '\n', '   2. We are investigating how determinants of chromosome structure\n', '   regulate chromosome segregation and DNA repair, with an emphasis on\n', '   events that occur during DNA replication.\n', '\n', '\n', '   Chromosomes are highly dynamic structures. They undergo massive\n', '   reorganization to enable DNA replication and chromosome segregation to\n', '   occur. This is under the control of the DNA topoisomerases, and three\n', '   related and interacting Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC)\n', '   complexes known as cohesin, condensin and the Smc5/6 complex. Defects\n', '   in the processes controlled by these enzymes are a potent inducer of\n', '   chromosome segregation defects leading to changes in chromosome number\n', '   (aneuploidy). Their function during DNA replication appears to be\n', '   particularly important, where they control recombination to ensure a\n', '   complete round of replication by overcoming obstacles that block\n', '   polymerases, which is then followed by chromosome reorganization in\n', '   preparation for mitosis.

What's up with that?\n", '\n', '   Can we develop a drug to mimic all the protective effects of dietary\n', '   restriction? (Yes!)\n', '\n', '   Our laboratory uses histological, behavioral, electrophysiological, and\n', '   molecular, methods (including DNA microarrays and RNA interference) to\n', '   assess the basic mechanisms by which hypothalamic neurons sense and\n', '   regulate metabolic state (including body weight and food intake), and\n', '   how these mechanisms are impaired in metabolic diseases and during\n', '   aging. A driving question of our laboratory is what may be called the\n', '   metabolic mystery. This refers to the fascinating phenomenon that\n', '   obesity is a risk factor for most age-related diseases and indeed for\n', '   mortality, and conversely dietary restriction appears to slow down the\n', '   aging process and extend maximum lifespan. Considering that almost all\n', '   major pathologies are influenced by caloric intake, the mechanisms\n', '   underlying the metabolic mystery may be considered among the most\n', "   compelling in biomedical science. We really don't understand why\n", '   caloric intake should lead to diseases, but many lines of evidence\n', '   suggest neuroendocrine mechanisms. We have begun to study the nature of\n', '   the hypothalamic neurons which are sensitive to nutrition and which in\n', '   turn regulate metabolic state, and we have thus begun to define a\n', '   "nutritional field" of neurons which contain overlapping domains\n', '   sensitive to different nutrients and which regulate different aspects\n', '   of metabolism. Of particular interest is that the maximum overlap of\n', '   these nutritional stimulation (e.g., glucose and leptin) may occur\n', '   within the POMC neurons, which we now believe play a critical role in\n', '   regulating metabolism. This is particularly interesting because the\n', '   POMC neurons are among the most sensitive to decline during aging. To\n', '   begin to directly test the role of specific gene products in the\n', '   development of obesity, diabetes, and aging, we have now produced\n', '   several lines of transgenic mice that overexpress leptin, POMC,\n', '   insulin, and glucokinase specifically in the brain, and we are now\n', '   assessing the effects of these transgenes in obesity, diabetes, and\n', '   aging. For example, we have now shown that transgenic enhancement of\n', '   neuronal POMC will completely correct the diabetes and other\n', '   impairments in genetically obese mice. These studies have led to\n', '   discovery of a new class of anti-obesity drugs that we are now\n', '   studying. A new direction in our laboratory involves examining function\n', '   of metabolic genes we have discovered using microarrays using RNA\n', '   interference protocols in mice and in C. elegans. Using high-throughput\n', '   RNAi screening methods we have discovered over 20 novel genes that\n', '   regulate obesity in C. elegans. Using a similar approach we have also\n', '   discovered a transcriptional complex that mediates the protective\n', '   effects of dietary restriction to increase lifespan and protect against\n', '   age-related diseases, including Alzheimer-type pathology and diabetic\n', '   complications. Pharmacological activation of this pathway increases\n', '   lifespan and protects against neurodegenerative diseases, and the same\n', '   complex predicts lifespan and obesity in mice.

['   We work on synaptic plasticity, the aging brain, and the synaptic basis\n', '   of age-related cognitive decline. We are particularly interested in the\n', "   distinction between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the more modest\n", '   disruption of memory often referred to as age-associated cognitive\n', '   impairment or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that often occurs in the\n', '   context of normal aging. While age-associated cognitive impairment\n', '   represents a major health problem on its own that must be solved,\n', '   preventing the transition from MCI to AD is a related goal of enormous\n', '   importance given the rising threat and cost of AD to western society.\n', '   In order to achieve either goal, we need to understand the cellular,\n', '   synaptic, and molecular basis of the earliest age-related alterations\n', '   that lead to cognitive decline and how these events relate to the\n', '   complex physiology of aging, such as the aging of endocrine systems\n', '   that affect the brain, or the interactions between stress and aging.\n', '   For example, in AD, the cortical neurons that provide the complex\n', '   connections that mediate cognition degenerate, leading to the\n', '   catastrophic loss of cognitive function evident in dementia. Unlike AD,\n', '   significant neuron death does not occur in normal aging and thus does\n', '   not appear to be the cause of the initial stages of age-associated\n', '   cognitive impairment. While these circuits do not die in normal aging,\n', '   we have shown that they are vulnerable to sub-lethal age-related\n', '   alterations in structure, synaptic integrity, and molecular processing\n', '   at the synapse, all of which impair cognitive function in\n', '   well-characterized animal models. In addition, while synapse loss\n', '   occurs in aging, all synapses are not equally vulnerable and all\n', '   regions do not age the same way. Our recent data on prefrontal cortex\n', '   show that there is a selective loss of the class of synapses that is\n', '   most plastic and likely to play a critical role in the cognitive\n', '   processes mediated by prefrontal cortex, yet the age-related synaptic\n', '   alterations in hippocampus are quite different, with minimal synapse\n', '   loss. Biochemical alterations of the synapse, such as shifts in\n', '   distribution or abundance of key neurotransmitter receptors, may also\n', '   contribute to memory impairment, particularly in hippocampus.\n', '\n', '   We have shown that the same brain regions and circuits vulnerable to\n', '   aging are responsive to circulating estrogen levels, suggesting that\n', '   critical interactions between reproductive senescence and brain aging\n', '   may affect excitatory synaptic transmission and cognitive performance.\n', '   In fact, estrogen treatment in aged female monkeys protected the\n', '   vulnerable class of synapses and restored cognitive performance to that\n', '   of young monkeys. Importantly, the effects of estrogen on these neurons\n', '   show that certain age-associated synaptic alterations may be\n', '   reversible, leading to the protection of cognitive performance observed\n', '   in these monkeys. These effects of estrogen give us a molecular and\n', '   therapeutic entry point to explore additional interventions and\n', '   strategies to protect against synaptic aging. If we can prevent the\n', '   synaptic aging of these circuits while still largely intact, we may be\n', '   able to protect individuals against the earliest stages of cognitive\n', '   decline and in turn, prevent the transition to the death of these\n', '   circuits that underlies AD.\n', '\n', '   A parallel area of research in our lab investigates the effects of\n', '   behavioral stress on neurons in the prefrontal cortex. We have shown\n', '   that stress leads to dendritic retraction on pyramidal neurons in\n', '   prefrontal cortex, and this leads to cognitive decline. Importantly, if\n', '   stress is discontinued these neurons recover, both structurally and\n', '   functionally. In addition, the specific neuronal responses to stress\n', '   differ between males and females. All of these studies were done in\n', '   young animals, but recently, we were able to link our investigations\n', '   into neuronal aging with our interest in behaviorally (i.e., stress)-\n', '   induced plasticity. While the dendrites of prefrontal neurons in young\n', '   animals recover from stress-induced retraction, this capacity for\n', '   recovery is absent in middle-aged and aged animals. Furthermore,\n', '   prefrontal neurons in middle-aged and aged rats lose spines with aging\n', '   in the absence of stress and are further stress-induced synaptic loss\n', '   or plasticity.  We are now pursuing the mechanisms responsible for\n', '   age-related loss of experience dependent plasticity.\n']

Our research focuses on the function of potassium ion\n', '   channels, which control the flow of potassium ions across the cell\n', '   membrane and generate one of the most important inhibitory signals in\n', '   the brain.\n', '\n', '   The appropriate balance and timing of excitatory and inhibitory signals\n', '   are critical for the normal function of neural circuits in the brain.\n', '   Research in the Slesinger laboratory focuses on a fundamental pathway\n', '   for inhibition in the brain that is mediated by G protein-coupled\n', '   receptors (GPCR) and G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium\n', "   channels (referred to as 'GIRK' channels). Many neurotransmitters in\n", '   the brain activate GPCRs which in turn opens GIRK channels. Previous\n', '   work in the lab has established that GIRK channels exist in a\n', '   macromolecular signaling complex that incorporates the channel, G\n', '   proteins, receptors and regulator proteins into a microdomain. We\n', '   identifed the first regulator of GIRK channel trafficking, SNX27, and\n', '   demonstrated that alcohol interacts directly with a physical pocket in\n', '   GIRK channels. The long-term goal of our research is to elucidate the\n', '   function of GIRK channels in the brain, with a particular emphasis on\n', '   their role in drug addiction and therapeutic potential. Currently,\n', '   there are several different projects in the laboratory that range from\n', '   molecular studies of GIRK channel function to identifying key pathways\n', "   and proteins altered in human's addicted to psychostimulants.\n"]
